PREFACE.

Is writing the following commentary on the plays ol Terence, my
chief aim has been to maintain the utmost brevity consistent with
clearness; auditis possible that some readers may consider me
too brief upon passages where a good deal of illustration is some·
times given. But lor an editor todo good service, it is necessary,
iu my opinion, that he should indicate at least aa much as he
actually gives in the way of explanation3 and Ι have accordingly
endeavoured to keep within bounds the tendcncy to quotation,
which is oue of the most human, and at the same time most trou-
blesome errors that a commentator can fall into. In the selectiou
of quotations my object has been to bring forward especially the
idioms of colloquial Latin as found in Plautus, parts of Cicero, and
occasionally in the earlier poets. For forms of words Plautus and
Lucretius hove been my chief authorities. I have endeavoured in

this way to make my book uselul to the student who wishes to

acquire a knowledge of the early Roman writers, and to direct him
in each case to the original authorities, as far as they have been
preserved to us, for language and idiom. The general reader will,
Ι hope, find sufficient help in the introductory matter which Ι
have prefixed to every play, and to every soene mecchol the
plays, as well as in the uote's themselves, in which 1 have never
consciously passed over any thing which was likely to be mis·
understood, or which hed been made the occasion of difficulty hy

previous commentatore.
