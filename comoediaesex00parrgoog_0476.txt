INTRODUCTION TO PHORMIO. 399

arranging to get rid of his wife for him. Chremes, meanwhile, has ¹
returned from Lemnos, and is in great perplexity about his wife and
daughter. He is as anxious as Demipho can be to get rid of this wife
of Antipho'e, and does his best to persuade his brother to airange
matters with Phormio. After thie affair is settled hc goes to make
inquiries for his family from Lemnos, when he falls in with Sophrona,
and finds to his unbounded astonishment that this wife of Antipho,
whom they have been so anxious to get rid of, is no other than his own
daughter Phanium. This discovery is imparted to Demipho after an
amusing scene of hints rendered necessary by the presence of Nausis-
trata (Act v. Sc. 3) ; aad the two old men are now as anxious to be off
their bargain with Phormio as they were to make it, and above alltc -
get back the thirty minae which the parasite had taken as Phanium's
portion. But they do not find it very easy to manage their scheme.
Phormio is ready enough to gire up Phanium, but has no intention of
parting with the money; aad when the old men attempt by fair means
or foul to get it back, Chremes discovers to his horror that Phormio has
discovered the secret of Phanium’s parentage‚ which Geta had over-
heard when Chremes first recognized his daughter in Demipho's house.
The result of all is that Phormio tells the whole story to Nausistmta.
Chremes is utterly confounded, and is quite unable to blame his son for
his amour with the music girl, when Phaedria describes to Nausistrata
the purpose for which the thirty minae were obtained. The play ends
with a conditional forgiveness of Chremes, and an invitation tc supper
sor Phormio

In the character of Phormio Terence copied from un original, in
which the standing idea of the parasite was strictly observed. Sec
notes on Act ii. Scene 2. We have seen avery different idea, though
with the same fondness for good living, worked out in the Eunuchus.
See the Introduction to that play. Phormio is, however, a very capital
specimen of his class, and shows far more readiness and amiability than
most of the tribe. It is not unworthy of remark that this play is said
by some to have been acted four times in one year. Aa all events, this
and the Eunuchus, the two most spirited of Terence’s plays, came on
the stage within six months.
