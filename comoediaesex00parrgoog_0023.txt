xvi INTRODUCTION.

in their presenoe; and that at the rehearsal he brought forward his ac·
cusations against Terence, which were, Ι may observe, entirely critical,
to the effect that the play was stolen from Naevius and Plautus.
'l'urning to the Prologue to the ‘Andria’ we find that the objections
which Terence notioes are of the same kind. He explains that he had
taken his materiale from two plays of Menander, the ‘Andria' and the
‘Perinthia' and then says, alluding ιο his opponente:

“Id isti vituperant factum3 atque in eo disputant,
Contaminari non decere fabulas.’' (vv. 15, 16.)

Taking the story of Caecilius as afact,-and it is not a likely one ιο have
been invented; for most of the stories about Terence are rather ιο his
disparagement,—we may conclude from it that the ‘Andria’ must have
been well known for some time before its production on the stage. At
this reading of the play before Caecilius there may have been present
some, and Lavinius himself, perhaps, among the number, who looked
’ . with no friendly eye on this young poet, promising as he did to gain a
large share of the applanse which they were anxious to monopolize.
nne author of the ‘Thesaurus’ and the ‘Phasma’ who endeavoured to
take the >public by storm hythe violent incidente of his plays, his
‘charmed fawn' and ‘running slaves and their mad masters' (see the
Prologues to the ‘Heautontimorumenos’ and ‘Phormio ’), would be
particularly likely to be jealous of a rising poet who sought to interest
by elegance of language and simple liveliness of plot. Caecilius was
delighted: his approbation would be a passport to popular success; the
days of clap-trop were numbered; and some fault of a literary kind
must be found with a poet who was likely to prove such a dangerous
rival. The ‘Andria’ might thus have become famous in literary circles
before this Prologue was written, and enough might have been said
against its author fully to account for the language which he uses.

'l'he general question of the opposition to Terence is an important
one. It is alluded ιο iu all the Prologues, with the exception of those
ιο the ‘Hecyra’ which are occupied with an explanation of the causes
which led to the previous failnres of that play. These prologues there·
fore are entirely scenic; but it is most probable that, if it had not been
for the untoward circumstances which had attended the previous repre·
sentations of that play, we should have had some more notices of the
poet‘s literary position. It will be useful, therefore, ιο say a few words
