“ -- Eas fabulas factas prius

Latinas scisse sese id yero pernegat.”

(vs. 83, 84.)

'l'he second accusation against Terence is, that he was indebted to his
noble friends for the plays which he produced aa his own. This charge
ismeutioned by Cicero: “Secutus sum, non dico Caecilium (malus
enim auctor Latinitatis est), sed Terentium, cujus fabellae propter ele-
gantiam sermonis putabantur a O. Laelio scribi’‘ (Ad Atticum vii. 3),
and by Quintilian: “ In comoedia maxime claudicamus. Licet Terentii
scripta ad Scipionem Africanum referentum quae tamen sunt in hoc
genere elegantissima'’ (nl. 100). In the life of Terence, ascribed to
Suetonius (or Donatus), Q. Memmius is quoted as saying, “ Pub. Afri·
canus, qui, a Terentio personam mutuatus, quae domi luserat ipse no·
mine illius in scenam detulit.’' The same writer mentions on the
authority ot' Nepos, that O. Laelius being at his willa near Puteoli, on
the calenda of March, was requested by his wife to comete supper
sooner than was his custom, for that day was the feast ‘Matronalia’ on
which the ladies were allowed to rule supreme in their households. In
reply he begged te be excused, as he was busily engaged 3 and on catering
the supper-roem at a later hour, he declared that he had never in'his
life been so well satisfied with his writings3 and when they aslred him ι
to let them hear what he had written, he repeated the linceos the
‘'Heautontimorumenos,’ cemmencing

“Satis pol proterve me Syri promissa huc induxerunt.”
' (Act. IV. Scene iv. v. 1.)

Thia story Nepos gives upon what he calls certain informatiou. We must
observo that Cicero and Quintilian both mention the repert merely as one
Ι of heersay; and Santra,awriter of the age of Julius ansar, commenting
on the story, remarks that it is not probablc thot Terence would have
'been indebted to men of the age oi Scipio and Laelius, for they were
both young at that time, but ratberto Q. Fabius Labeo or O. Sulpicius
Gallus, or distinguished men of their age, ol' whom he might more justly

hm md, “Qui vobis universis et populo placent;

Quorum opera in bello, in otio, in negotio,
Suo quisque tempore usus eat sine superbis.’'·
(adelphi, Prolog. vv. 19-21.)
