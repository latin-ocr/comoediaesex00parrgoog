TERENOE AND THE NEW OOMEDY. 495

παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως λαμβάνειν, καὶ ταῦτ’ ἀεὶ
ἔλεγεν· διὰ ταύτην ἢν λίγα τὴν δωρεὰν
ἐνιαυτὸν ἔσχε μ’ ὃ κακοδαίμων δωρεάν.

HEAUTONTIMORUMENOS.

In the Prologus to this play Terence says:

“Ex integra Graeca integram comoediam
Hodie sum neturus Heautontimorumenon3
Duplex quae ex argumento facta est simplici.'¹

(vv. 4—6.)

It hasbeen maintained in the note on that passage that these words of
Terence most probably mean that ‘now there are two plays on the same
subject, a Greek and a Latin one,’ and in accordance with this view we
find no other play but the Ἑαυτὸν τιμωρούμενος of Menander notioed by
any authority as the original of the ‘Heautontimorumenos’ The
extant verses of Menander to which wa can find a parallel in the Latin
play are very few. The following passages may be compared.

Hesut. i. 1. 9, 1οε

“ Nam proh Deum atque hominnm fldem, quid vis tibi?
Quid quaeris? annos sexaginta natus es.”

1the Sopoliast on Plato (Behlr. p. 380) has preserved these lines ol
Ionan er:

τοσαῦθ’ ; ὁμοῦ γάρ ἔστιν ἑξήκοντά σοι.
(Frag. Ἑαυτ. ἰ.)

Menedemus, describing his feelings when he returned to the comforts
of his home after the loss of his son, says:

“Ubi video haec, coepi cogitare: ‘Hemt tot mea
Solius solliciti sint carme, ut me unum expleant?
Ancillae tot me vestiant? sumtus domi
Tantos ego solus faciam θ’ ” (Heaut i. 1. 76-79.)

In the following fragment of Menander,
Λουτρὸν θεραπαίνας ἀργυρώματα, (Fragm. Ἑαυτ. li.)

we probably have a portion of'a similar speech where the old manis
describing, with more detail than he does in Terence, the various pre-
