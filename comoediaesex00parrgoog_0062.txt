INTRODUO'I'ION. lv

rnle the preceding examples embraoe all the usual cases of the accentua-
tion of dissyllabic words on the last syllable. A few others are found
in similar positione, and of these many are contrected verbs, aa redit,
obit, Ae, where the contraction affects tha quantity os the syllable as
much es tbe position.

β. Last syllables oi polysyllabis words lengthened by ‘ictus :’

“ Maledicere maleficta ne noscent sua.” ·
(And. Prol. 23.)
“Potin As mihi verum decre! Nihil fiscibus?
(And. ii. 6. 6.)
“Poetae ad scribendum augeat industriam.”
(Adelph. Prol. 25.)

1 do not mention here the numerous cases of words occurring at tha
end of a line where the metre necessarily requires along syllable. On
the other hand we have one instance at least in Terence os the
ahortening of aflnal syllable, in spite of its position, oecurring in tbe
liceis of the last foot:

“ Video: horsum pergunt. Quid dicam hisce incertae sum.”
(Hec. iii 4. 36.)

γ. Penultimate syllables of polysyllabio words shortened in pronun·

dalion, the secent being thrown back.
A great many instances of this practice are given by Lindemann
from Plautus. See his introduction ‘De Prosodia Puuau’ p. xiv, xv.

The following passages may be quoted from Terence:

“ - Si quando ssla dicet, Phaedriam

Comissatum intromittamus: tu Pdmphilam.”
· (Eun. iii. 1. 51, 52.)

“Si id est peceatum peecatum impruddntiaest.” ,
(Eun. Prol. 27.)

“Homo de improvis03 coepit eldmore, 0 Aeschine.”
(Adelph. iii. 3. 53.)

“Metui ne haereret hic. Atque (roim admodum.'’
(Adelph. iii. 3. 49.)

“Penuria est: horno antiqua mitum ec fide.'’
(Adelph. iii. 8. 88.)
