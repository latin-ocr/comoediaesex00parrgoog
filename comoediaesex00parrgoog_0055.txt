’ xlviii INTRODUOTION. “

From a comparison of all the cases of Synizesis which have come
under my observation, the following general rules seem to srise,
which may serve aa a guide to us in-determining the limite of this
licence. “

1. The majority of words in which this contr-action takes place are ·
either dissyllabic or inflectione ¹of words dissyllabic in their first case.

2. Words having a medinl consonant are sometimes contracted, asin ’
the case of ⁶ habent,' ‘student’ ‘jube,’ ao. from the predominance of the
vowel sound3 but in the great majority of cases the medinl consonantis
a liquid; and in the few cases where two consonante intervene be-
tween the vowels, one of them must be a liquid.

3. Such words are generally nouns or particles, not verbs. Ihave,

. however, referred to the head of Synizesis several verbs, which are treated
by Ritschl ns instances of words having a shortened final syllable, such
as colo,jude, adi, vide, bc. For why make these words an exception to
the rulo that prevails in so many analogous cases? We pronounce
adi = ai as naturally as pater = pire: royc is as ready a monosyllnble
as άοηηιε, or acerna 1 ’
· 4. In many cases of synizesis the contracted word cr syllable may
coalesco with avowel, aa if it were a mere vowel or diphthong. This is
frequent in Terence with tici, eibi, mili, ibi, and other words, of which
instances have already been noticed in the course of this section.

ΙΙ. emmonem.

The word ‘synaloepha’ applies more particularlytothosecaseswhere
a final vowel, or syllable ending in ·m, coalesces with the initial vowel of
the following word. For ‘Elision’ in our sense of the word was
unknown to the Romans3 as appears from the express testimony of
Quinctilian, x. 4. 39: “Atqui eadem illa litera m, quoties ultima est et
vocalem verbi sequentis ita contingit utin eam transire possit, etiam si
scribitur, tamen parum exprimitur, ut: multam illc, et: quantum erm,⁸
sdeo ut paene cujusdam novae literae sonum reddat. Neque enim ex·
pellitur, sed obscuratur, et tantum aliqua inter duas voculas velut nota
ο est ne ipsae coeant.'’ And so in the following lines we ought to pro·

nounce

“vos naa intro'iufertessbite. sorar (Ana i. 1. 1,)
