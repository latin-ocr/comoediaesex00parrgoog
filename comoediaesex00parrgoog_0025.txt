xviii INTRODUOTION.

Romnum· whose great light was Plautus, who praised his Roman nit
and national phraseology and manners.

The difficulty of Terence's position lay in this, that he was endea-
vonring to recall the popular taste from the broad fares which had been
sohappily introduced by Plautus ιο a more artistic model, from the rude
nond-cute as it were of popular fun and low life ιο the finished line

engravings of classic dialogus. Terence aimed at au inprovemsnt of the
public taeta, he sought to educate as well as to pleasc,—a difficulttaskin
those carly days of the Drama. Imagines temporary scaffolding in the
contre of tho amphitheatra, with all the distractione of the Graat Games,
-boxirig matchcs, the tight rope, and above all the gladiatorial contests,
ever the truc poetry of the Roman people,-and you will ses that Roman
Comcdy must uecds have been rather rude to hold its ground with the
multitudo. Under such circumstances, and with such an audience
Plautus is, and will continue ιο be popular, sor he swims with the
atroam, and is carried on merrily on its surface, while he “expressa
arbusto regerit convicia,” and clothes even his most foreign personages
with ο good homely mantle of Roman wit and phraseclcgy. Terence,
cn tha contrary, is endeavouring to force the stream backwards, cr
rutlnu to turn it srom aliving gushing river of broad life and merri·
ιοοιιι into an ornamental lake, laid out according to the true lawa
ol nrt, and rcllccting column and terrace, and well-ordered ranlrs of
cypressos arrd urns. It is interesting and not uninstructive to compare
hia stnrgglos in tha cause of art with Moliera’s early attempta to gain a
recognition for a very different school of Comedy in the palmy· days οἰ

wora very dillhrcnt, and so was their success; but this is easily to be
accountod sor by the preceding consideration, that the efforts of Moliere
wore in unisou with the natural though repressed sympathies of the
peoplo, while the plays of Terence, however highly appreciated by
computent judges, must have always been ιο some extent φωνᾶντα

We now come tc the particular charges against Terence. They fall
under three heads3—1.Plagiarism from Greek copies both in subject
aud in the characters of his plays (see Prol. to Andria, Eunuchus, aud
Heautontimorumenos) 3—2. The aid of distinguished friends (Prol. to
Adelphi and Heautontimorumenos, r. 24) 3—3. Tha want of spirit and
