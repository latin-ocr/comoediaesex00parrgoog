talium? ‘gloriam’ ‘nesc'ihf and accordingly wo always have ‘gratiis’
and· ‘ iugratiia,‘ rather than the contracted form. In Terence we meet
with one clear exception at least to this rulo in the case of propitia
See Adelph. i. 1. d:

“ Irdta quam illa quae parentes prdpitio' ;”
and Phormio iv. 3. 31 :
“Satin illi Di sunt propitii? Nam sat scio.”

I do not quote ‘gratiam' which occurs in some few places, as an
example, because in all those instances the text has been objected to.
'dhare can be no doubt, however, that we have in these passages the
genuine reading‚.aud that the contractiora must taho place in such
passages as the following:

“ O'mnibus qratiam htbeo‚ et seorsum tibi praeterea, Demea.”
(Adelph. v. 9. 14. See note.)

“ Referetque qratiam ei, unaque nos sibi opera amicos jr‘mget.”
(Hec. v. 2. 32.)

Among more common words, aiva, aiat, mili, tibi, citi, oi, are often
pronounoed as monosyllablea‚ and consequently sometimes they coalesco
in pronunciatiou with the initial vowel of a following word.

The following more remarkable casea of words controoted in pronun·

. clation may be referred to this place:

fhoillo. “Atque ssli faoilloc plena, fumi ac pollinis.”
(Adelph. r. 3. 60.)
Pythias. “Nonffciam Pythias. Non pol credo, Ohadreaff’
(Eun. v. 3. 62.)

praecepa(in the “hdolescenti ipsi eriperem oculos: posthac praa·
oblique cases) capitc‘m darem,” (Adelph. iv. 5. 5,)

where we may also notice the contractiora of adolescenti and owloa.

mapsa As “Nunquam aedepol quicquam jdm diu quod mdpia vellem
evenire.¹’ .(Eun. v. 6. 1.)

1 may hera remark that in tha case of Greek worda tou coruscum did not take placa
Thus we have in Eun. iii. ³. la, ‘⁸ Rus Sunii oequod habersm.'' There wera also many
latin words that did not admit it, aa sollum, solium, imae, molium, gladia, alodiam.
