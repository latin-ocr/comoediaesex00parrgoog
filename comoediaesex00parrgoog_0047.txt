xl INTRODUOTION.

Hecyra v. 8. 32 ⁸. One instance occurs in which mado is pronounoed
as a dissyllable with its llrst syllable lengthenedz

“Mihine? Tibi ergo. mado introii. Quasi ego qnam duddm
rogem.” (Andria v. 2. 9.)

The reader will observo that the position 01 qnasi also in the same line
is paculiar. Both cases are probably due in this instance to the metrical
cocant, combined with the broken form ol the sentences.

, royo. ’ “deo: negat vidisse.” (Andria ii. 2. 21.)

“Heus Demea, royat freter ne abeas longius.”
(Adelph. v. 5. 1.)

“ dea velitne exdram an non.”
(Hec. iv. 1. 43.)

‘¹ Ut alpem, quod tempus conveniendi patris me capere jribeat.”
(Phorm. v. 4. 9.)

6. Words compounded of prepositions, dcc. ending in a vowel ars
contracted. 'lhe following cases occur:

deamo. “ Nae ego fdrtunatns homo sum. Deomc td, Syre.”
(Heaut. iv. 6. 21.)
dehortor. “At hic dehortatio est me ne illam tsbi darem.’'
¹ (Phorm. v. 7. 17.)

dein, dende, very often in all writers. In one instance this word is
resolved by Terence:

“ Nunc primum fac istaec lavet3 post deinda’'

(Andria iii. 2. 3,)
where ‘deinde' forms a bacchius (⁹⁶ ').

dehinc ; always contracted.

demeum. “Ne sfirsum aaran cairsitea.” (Eun. ii. 2. 46.)
Compare Adelph. iv. 2. 34. 36.

scoram. “ O‘mnibus gratiam habe03 et scaram tibi praeterea Demea.'’
(Adelph. v. 9. 14.)

⁶ Itis remarkable that no csse 01 ⁴ modus ' is eonhscted in Terence. This leads me 10
doubt Professor Key’s derivation 01 ‘immo’ cr ⁴ imo’ from ‘in modo‚’ to say nothing 01
any other abjectiori tc it. See note on aromatiten. ln such a osse the absence 01 a
matraction in Terence (and, ss far as 1 have examined the word, in Plautus) is to my
mind decisivo. The case 01 ‘modd’ shows indeed that it would have been possible to
abbreviato the ablativa ‘modo' similarly3 butas vs do not find this to bave been the
case, we mast not coin a matrsction lor the salte 01 the emmelagy.
