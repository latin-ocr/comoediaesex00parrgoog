xsvxvi INTRODUOTION.

“Volui quintu in 1111 mihifacris adversatrix, Sostrata.''
(Heaut. 1. 3. 5.)

rho same contractior occurs always in fierit ; once in suaset .·

‘¹ N 611 potitus essem ι fuisset tum 11111 mihi aegre aliquot dies‚'’

(Phorm. i. 3. 7,)
and inficians.-

“Et gratum id saissa advorsum 11 11111 gritiam.”
‘ (1111111.)

“ Aeschine audi: nd 11 ignarum subsc dicas meorum morum.”

(Adelph. ii. 1. 6.)
Compare also Heo. iii. 5. 39.

Ritschl would exclude from contraction all inflectione· of fici in which
‘r’ occurs, except perhaps fierunt. 'Phe preceding instances, however,
are decisive, as far as Terence is concerned‚ that in all cases of words in
which ‘n’ is followed hy a vowel synizesis 11 possible, though not uni-
versal. In all 111 words instanced above 111 1111 many instances ol
their full pronunciaticn. I now pass to words in which ‘u' occurs with
some other ‘vowel ’ from which it is separated by a consonant.

jace. “ Viden? Video. Comprehendi jube quantiam potest.”
(Eun. v. 1. 20.)
“Atque bdnc in horto maceriam jube dirui.”
(Adelph. v. 7. 10.)

“Argentum rursum joba rescribi, Phormio.”
(Phorm. v. 7. 29.)

pudet. In Terence I find no instance of tbe monosyllabic pronuncia·
tion of ‘pudet’ and ‘pudor' which occurs in Plautus. One such word
is however thus used in Terence. In Adelphi i. 1. 48 we have a linc,

which both Bentley and Bitschl bave endeavoured to alter in consequence
of 111 metrical difficulty. It stands thus:

“ Studet pat referre; praeseus absensque idem erit.’¹

He‘re Bentley, according tobis custom, considers the last syllable of
‘studet’ to be shortened in spite of its position: 11111111 would amend
111 line by omitting ‘pan’ See 111 note. 'Phe simplest way is to con·
· sider ⁶ studat’ as a monosyllable, without having recourse to any arbi·
trary change. Compare
