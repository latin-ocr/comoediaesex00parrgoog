INTRODUOTION.

..-—-——-—-

In this play we have two brothers, Demipho and Chremes. Chremes
had marmed a lady of property, named Nausistrata, whose estates lay in
the island of Lemnos, and by whom hs had a son called Phaedria. Once
ayear Chremes used to go to Lemnos to collect his rents, ιιι used ιο
stay there on each occasion rather longer than was necessary, while the
rents which he brought home to his wife were less than in former
times when the prices os farm produce was not so high ιι ιι this tima
(compare v. 8. 23, 24, and v. 3. 4-8), which appeared unaccountable to
his wife, who did not however suspect him of any thing beyond careless-
ness and indolence in the management oi her business. But it had
happened that about fifteen years before the events of this play be had
fallen in love with a Lemnian woman, by whom he had a daughter
called Phanium. So for fifteen years he had two wives and two esta·
blisbments, with perfect secrccy, sor at Lemnos he went by the name of
Stilph03 while he put off his wife’s complaints about the short rents by
excuses oi bad times, ill health, ιιι so on. His brother Demipho had .
ason named Antipho, and they ιιι agreed that Chremes should now

go to Lemnos, ιιι bring over his wife and daughter, ιιι ιιιι ιιι
cousins should be married ιι οιοι, Phanium passing for the daughter of

a friend. With this object Chremes now makes hia yearly visit ιο
Lemnos; ιιι Demipho at the sometime goes to Cilicia, where ha
expects ιο ιιι ι larga fortune3 while their two sons, Antipho aad
Phaedria, are left under ιιι charge ol Geta, an old family servant of
Demipho's, who acted as their paedagogus. At first Geta endeavoured
to discharge his duty ιο his master faithfully3 but finding that this .
conduct got him nothing but abusa, he altered his line, and gave hia
two pupils every indulgence they demanded. This soon produced the
results which might have been anticipatsd. Phaedria fell madly in love
with a music girl, whom he diligently escorted every day to and from
the school where she used to go for her finishing lessons; but his case
was desperate, for ιι ιιι not a sarthing and she could not be got
from Dorio, the ‘leno,’ without hard caah. Nor was it long before
