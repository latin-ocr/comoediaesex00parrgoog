INTRODUOTION. xxiii

in the Dietioaary 01 Biography on the position 01 Terence in Comedy,
who fairly shows that this ‘⁴ ris eomiea¹' could hardly be expected in the

majority 01 Terence’s plays, which are more properly “sentimental eome-
dies,” aad that he may be classed with those who have excelled ia manner
rather than in matter, with Massiuger‚ Recine, aad Allieri, rather than
with Aristophanes, Shalvespeare, or Meliore. What Greek poets are alluded
10 by Caesar we cannot definitely say. Assar as fragments 01 Menander
and his class have deseended 10 us,I should be inclined to ray that ι
Terence 10 001 deficientia humour by their side, and the wit 01 Plautus
vvaa certainly native, fresh from thabatha and the iorum. Caesar'a
reading may have embraced Aristophanes, who found ne antitype
among the Romam. At all events we may well be enatent with the
eleganee and purity 01 eur poet’s diction, and with the genuine wit
which appears in a dry subdued sorm in almost every page 01 his
worhs.

This question is well stated by aa able writer ia the ‘Quarterly
Review,’ who has given a discriminating shetclr 01 the merita 01
Terence in the following words: “What ia 10 00 repugnant in the plots

similar incidents; the lost or stolen maidea in slavery, who turns out

the harsh and themild, the rusticor the citizen3 the two sons; the
