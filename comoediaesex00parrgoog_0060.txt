INTRODUOTION. liii

elwoys claim the liberty os making any innovation that they chose on
ordinary eustoms.

Bentley, indeed, justly derides the excessivo menie for ‘Licences' in
the following words: “Nimirum hi non ipsos Poetae, non artem et
rhythmi genium, sed librarios sibi duces sumunt; et tot sere licentiarum
species sibi fingrmt quot in toto Plauto Terentioque vitiosae lectiones
nunc restant; unique loco, qui emendandus eret, ex altero neque men·
doso patrocinium quaerunt.” At the seme time he falls into the error
of treeting words contreeted by common pronunciation, such as studet,
seror, moral, and many others, es if they were shortened in spite of their
position. For exemplos I may refer the reeder to the list os passages
in bis Σχεδίασμα; all ol' which ore to be explained by ‘Synizesis’ or
‘synaloepha’ Bitschl's riews, and Lindemann’s‚ are in, the main more
sound; but they both occasionally mix metrioal consideratione with the
subjectos language; end Bitsohl, though he seems to consider thet all
such words es those which we have considered ere most properly to be
referred to connection, yet throughout his chapter on this head he
speaks of the words es ‘having the first, or second, syllable short! His
treetise is, however, exceedingly valuable, even in spite of his great love
of emendation, which, with him es with his great predecessor, Bentley,
too frequently spoils what he wishes to imprnm’.

We heve already seen that the comic poet had to preserve a just
balance between the common pronunciation of lengrrage end'the metrieal
necent. In other words, the foundation ol' metro was the quantity
eombined with the observauce of the accent es fer es possible ¹. In
the ordinary pronunciation ol Latin the accent never fell on the lest
syllable ol' any word ².

⁸ An editor may fairly in s note use the ordinary lenguage os metre to illustrate any
peculiarity ol s line. lie may say, This cannot be s dartyl in plaos ol a trocheo, where
these words save him a long explanation. Accordingly, to express my meaning brietly, 1
here occasionally used such terms in my notem and have spoken ol syllables being
shortened, &c where the more accurate expression would haro been thet the word was
00an in pronunciation. But in su express dismssion ol the subject ol metre end
pronundstion tlre editor should be osreful not to ooniouud the two subjecte. The metre
oi Terence is deceased in its place.

¹ See Ritsehl, Prolegomens‚ cap. xv. Ihsve ln the following remarks been indebted both
to him snd to Lindemann.

² See the passages quoted hy Bentley in his Σ χεδίασμα.
