elders, belongs in this playto Phormio. A similar analysis might be
extended to every character in Terence. No two are preoisely alihe.
How different is the Pamphilus of the ‘Andria’ from his namesake of
the ‘Hecyra l’ vvhat a marked contrast between Bacchis of the ‘Heau-
tontimorumenos’ and Bacchis of the ‘Hecyra ;‘ between the two pairs
of old men in the ‘Heautontimorumenos' and the ‘Adelphis between
Sostrate and Nausistrata, Pythias and Mysis; between Thais and
others of her class! A close study of Terence will enable any reader to
amplify these remarks to any extent, and to verify sor himself what I
can here state only briefly, that both in the grouping and in the treat-
ment of his characters Terence is an original as compared with Plautus3
' -a comparison too lengthy to be instituted here, even if it were the
proper place sor it. Whether he copied Menander closely we cannot say ;
but from the hints that we can glean from scattered fragments of the
Greek comedians, Ι for my partam inclined to conclude that he was in
a great measure original even when compared with Menander.

Ilvery edition of Terence that I have seen has some curione informa-
tion on the nomenclatura of the characters of Terence. N ames had, no
doubt, as they now have, their etymology, and certain general observa·
tions respecting them may hold good; aa, for example, the common deri·
ration of the names of slaves, male and female, from the countries from
which slaves were generally obtained ; the names that were in vogue to
distinguish courteaans from women of good position. But we can only
laugh at the commentator, however ancient and respectable, who tells ns
that Simo was a name given to an acrinmnious and suspicions old
gentleman, because ‘⁶ Simi fere sunt iracundi,” or that another old gen·
tleman, Chremes, derives his name from χρίμπτεσθαι, enias cxspmre,
for “old men are often troubled with an inveterate oough,’' while
cariously enough the same name is given in another play toa young
rnan; why, commentatore wisely decline to say. Such investigatione are
to be paralleled only by the pertinacity of the old commentators on
Horace in giving to every Lydia and Chloe apostrophized by the poet a
local habitation anda history. We have no reason to suppose that
Terence or any other comio poet went so far in the esoleric application
of their nomenclatura. The Drama has always had its regular reper-
tory of names as wellas of dresses; and we may as well endeavour to
find a moral in the Guys and Amelias of the modern novel as in a
Pamphilus, aMenedemus, or a Simo. I have therefore allowed these
speculations to rest in tha dust in which I found them3 and I hope they
