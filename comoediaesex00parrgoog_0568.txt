TERENOE AND THE NEW GOMEDY. 491

both Donatus and Ilugraphius notice that Terence uses tho &man
name, while Menander had expressly mentioned Ἄρτεμις, See the note ’
on the passage.

The “Perinthia’ of Menander furnishes us with two fragments only
capable of being identified with Terence’s play. The first scene, as has
been already observed, was transferred nearly word for word to the
‘Andria' by Terence. The following passages may be compared with
parts of the Latin play:

οΰδεμίαν ἡ γραῦς ὅλως
κύλικα παρῆκεν ἄλλα πίνει τὴν κύκλῳ,
(Fragm. Περινθ. v.)

’ wbbbb bena aba probably bb belong bb aba aaaapaon of ‘bebba’ aba
‘obstetria’ Compare

“Audivi Archylis jamdudum: Lesbiam adduci jubes.
Sane pol illa temulenta est mulier et temeraria,'’
and Ο (And. i. 4. 1, 2‚)

τὸ παιδίον δ’ εἰσῆλθεν tyrroda dipov, (vi.)
of which we probably find an imitation in

“ - Etiam puerum inde abiens conveni Chremi
Olera et pisciculos minutos ferre obolo in coenam seni,”

(aba. a. 2. 31, aa)

whatever may be the true reading of this difficult line. , See the note.

Besides these passages, which can be maced to one or other of tho
achnowledged prototypus oi the ‘Andria' there are two others which
seem to have been imitated by Terence in that play:

'layo α’ ἔθηκα δοῦλον ὄντ’ ἐλεύθερον.
(Meinelre, Fragm. (lamio. Anonym. xiii.)

This is quoted by Aristode, Soph.,1llench. 4, as an instance of au
ambiguous sentence. We may compare

“ Feci e servo nt esscs libertus mihi,”
(And. i. 1. 10,)

though there seems good reason for hesitatirig to refer the fragment to
tho ‘ Andria’ of Menander. See Meineke as quoted above.
Finally, we are informed by Donatus on Andria v. 5. ὃς

“ Ego Deorum vitam propterea sempiternam esse arbitror
Quod voluptates eorum propriae sunt3 nam mihi immortalitas
Parta est si nulla aegritudo huic gaudio intercesserit,”
