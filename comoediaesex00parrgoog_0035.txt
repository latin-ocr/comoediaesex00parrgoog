weare to eall ‘thdnt del' an anapaest. Many euch caseswillbe noticcd
in the course oi the following remarks. What has been said ie suffi-
cient to show the importance of examining fully the pronunciation of
the Roman language at the time of Terence and Plautus. This subject
has been noticed by the author of the ‘Varronianus’ (chap. x.), who
refers to the ‘Journal of Education’ (vol. ii. p. 844, δια), where it
is treated generally iu a manner which leaves nothing ior others.
For the general principles ol Latin pronunciation, as exhibited in the
shortened forme ol the tenses oi verbs, of compound words,'ol words
united by juxta-position, I may refer to those treatiees. My own object
is to examine this question in reference especially to Terence-from
whom both the writers abore mentioned hare drawn many of their
illustratione-and to ascertain from his writings, irrespectiwely of ‚other
sources, some at least of the most marked peculiarities of the pronun·
ciation ol the Latin language. We may lay it down generally that the
language oi Terence is that ol the common conversation ol middle life,
removed no less from the reflnement of the educated scholar than from
tha rustic patoie which we may osten observa in Plautus. This dif-
ference is no more than we should expect from the circumstances oi the
two poete. Plautus working at the mill for his livelihood‚ and Terence,

' the reputed friend of Scipio and Laelius, were likely to present us with

very different specimene of the language ol their day. Terence’s cha-
racters talk as the respectable Roman of that day talked. Even his
slaves and maid-servants are not vulgar.

Paesing then to details, Ι shall first examine the language of Terence,
and then his metree. Under the first inquiry will fall the pronun-
ciation ol his words, and the various usages which go by the name of

‘poetic licences,’ many oi them not so much licences as examples of the
common pronunciation of the Latin language. ⁴

The first case which I shall notice is that of corrasormu of two
syllables or rowels into one, known by grammariaus as ‘Emesam' of
which several classes may be distinguished.

ol tha ‘Miles Gloriosus‚' dre, and by thschl in his ⁴ Prolegoruena! Ι need not say that
my instances are dua to my own examinatior ol the text oi Terence.
