his unintelligible conductio working himself to death instead of super-
intending his slaves, and Menedemus explaining his reasons by aa
account of what led to his son's departure, and his consequent deter-
mination to punish himself till his return. Chremes being unable ιο
’ ιιιιιιὶι friend’s determination, returns ιο keep the festival of Bacchus
at his own house. There he finds tha party assembled, and what with
Bacchis aud the young men they make a pretty night of it, nearly
emptying his cellar, and turning the house upside down. Early next
morning Chremes, who has ι strong head for an old man, goes ιο meet
his friend Menedemus as becomes out to his work, and informs him of
his son’s return. He advises him to be cautious in receiving him, tells
him what sort of a life he ιιι to expect, and recommends him ιο ιο any
thing rather than openly encourage his son in such debauchery. Mene·
demus begs him ιο ιο any thing he can ιο bring about a reunion with
his son, eren if it be ιο encourage the young man ιιι Syrus to cheat
him in any imaginable way. , Chremes enters into the plan: ιιι encou-
rages Syrus ιο devise some schemo for making Menedemus supply
Clinia with the means of indulgence. Syrus has already some such
scheme on foot; but it is ιο ιι directed against Chremes, for he has
promised· Bacchis ten minae for her share in ιιι night's amusements, and
intends ιο get it out of his master. So he at once explains to his
master ι plausible scheme that ho has, namely, ιο induce Menedemus
ιο buy Antiphila from Bacchis, to whom she has been left in pawn by
Philtere, on ιιι representation that she is a captive from Caria whom
her friends are sure to ransom very handsomely. Meanwhile Sostrata
has discovered, through the medium of the aforesaid ring, that Antiphila
is her own daughter. This disconcerts Syrus, who now springs a new
mine; he sends Bacchis off to Menedemus‘ house, and explains to
Chremes that the only way ιο deceive Menedemus now, is ιο pretend
that she is Clitipho's mistress, ιιι ιι ιιι same time ιο get Clinia to
profess ιι attachment to Antiphila, and desim his father ιο demand her
in marriage, for then the old man would have ιο supply him with money
for the marriage, which of course would go to his mistress Bacchis. At
the same time Chremes is persuaded ιο release his daughter from her
pledge to Bacchis3 and the money is given ιο Clitipho to carry ιο Bacchis
for the purpose forsooth of more fully persuading Menedemus that she
is his mistress. At this point the deuouement takes place. Clitipho

. acts his part of Bacchis' lover a little too well, and all the circumstances

are discovered by Menedemus, who proceeds to inform Chremes of the
real state of the case. Now the two old men change places, Chremes is
enraged beyond measure at having been made the dupe of his dissolute
son, and Menedemus has to urge upon him the same maxims of forbear-
ance which Chremes ιιι used to him. Clitipho basto undergo a complete
