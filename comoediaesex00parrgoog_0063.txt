Many of the instanoes quoted by Lindemann and others under this
head may be referred to Synizesis. Such are mulierem (Adelph. i.
,2.10. Phorm. ii. 3. 89), oechoienitos (Adelph. Prol. 24), ηιάῑευοὶἰ
(And. Prol. 6), prohibui (And. i.1.113), mdla'tiam (Hoc. ii. 1. 6),
ηιέηιονίίεν (Phorm. ii. 3. 47), and eeqahnim' (Phorm. ii. 3. 8). There
are, however, many plain instances of the rulo, such aa

sketch of the pronunciation of Latin as it is found in Comedy, which we
have seen may be considered a fair representative of the common
colloquial usage of the day. Before proceeding to an examination
of the metros of Terence, I shall notice the oue remaining peculiarity of
Terenoe’s verse, which is generally included in the ‘Poetic Licenoes'
of our author.
Hrnrus.

‘Hiatus’ ss the word implica, is simply a break in the delivery of a
