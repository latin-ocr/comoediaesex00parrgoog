TERENCE AND THE NEW COMEDY.

Tun Roman Comedy possesses so much in common with the New .
Comedy of the Greeks, that, even were there -nc closer connexion
between the twc,a consideration of the literary position of Terence
would he incomplete without some notice cf the Greek authors from
whom he copied. And this becomes cssentisl, as a supplement to the ’
general consideration of Terence's literary position which' has been
undertaken in the Introduction to this volume, when we find that all
of the existiug plays cf Terence were confessedly copied from Greek
originale. We have already seen that Terence was in general termas
copyist. This objection was made against his plays, and answered
during his own lifetime. But Ι cannot but consider that this charge
has been pressed too closely. It is the fashicn to consider Terence's
plays as simple translations in the closest sense. It willtherefore be
interesting, and important for the due estimation cf cur author, tc
examine in detail the imitatione cf and allusione to Menander inhia
plays, which can he now ascertained. With this view I shall place
before the reeder those fragments cf the several plays of Menander
which have apparently been imitated by Terence. After such a state·
'ment of details we shell be prepared to go on to some more general
remarks upon the relation cf Terence to his Greek originale.

Tahing the plays in the order ln which we flnd them in Terence, ve
come first to the

axum.

This play was taken from the ‘Andria’ and the ‘Perinthia’ el
Menander. The most tmstvorthy acwnnt ol these plays is that which
Terence himself gives us in the Prologus to the ‘Andria’ vv. e-las

‘³ Menander fecit Andriam et Parinthiam.
Qui utramvis recte norit ambas noverit.
Non ita dissimili sunt argomento, sed tamen
Dissimili oratione sunt factae ac stilo.
