———-—

Paurrnna and Chremes were the children of an Athenian citizen. ,
Pamphila, while an infant, was carried off from her home at Sunium by
⁴ robbers, and hy them sold to a merchant of Rhodes. He presented her
to a courtesan of that place, who had her brought up with her own
daughter Thais as her younger sister. When Thais grew up she re·
moved to Athens with a lover of hers, who athis daath left her all
his property. She then kept company with a soldier named Thraso,
who went to Caria after living with her a short time. Mean-
