INTRODUGTION. larii

a continuativa of the measure. Bentley lays down the rulo that
trochaic octonarii ere always followed by trochaio verses, trochaic sep·
tenarii by iambic. Hermann (Epitome Doctrinae Metricos, Ι 186)
prefers the statement, that a verse ending with an ersis (accented

syllable) is followedby an iambic serse3 averse ending in a theris
(unaccented syllable) bya trochaic verse. This continuation of metre
isalso extended to the final syllables of verses, so that some lines, which
appear to bo hypermetrical‚ run into the following line, the two lines
being treated as one, and the last foot of the first line having therefore

the same measure es any other foot in the line. The following isan
maanes:
“Ego de me facilc conjecturlem. Nemo est meorlum amicorum
tediis ⁹
Aped quem exprom Ι ere (amnia ΙΙ mea occdlta, Oliltipho studeam?
(Heaut.iii.3.13,14.) ·
The same continuation occurs in some cases when the first syllable of a
line is connected by synaloepha with the last syllable of the preceding
line; and in many instances this continuation cf metro removes some
of the irregularities which annoy critics under the shape of shortened
syllables. Thus we may in the following lines consider ‘et’ to coalesco
with ‘modoz’
‘⁶ Sed epistolam ab eo allitam esse audiri nmdc,

Et ad portitores esse delatem3 hinc petam.’'
(Phorm. i. 8. 99, 100.) ·

The clausulae are often connected metrically with the lines which
they follow or precede, so as to form one regular werse iftahen with one
of the segments of the next line, as in Eunuchus ii. 1. 2 ε

“ Fiet, at maltdre fiet Ι setino hoc mandetldm est tibi? Ah
Rogitdre quasi Ι difficile sit.’'
We might arrange these lines thus:
“ Satine hoc mandatlum est tibi? Ab, rogitlsire, qnasi diflficile
sit.’'
Sometimes they are not connected, as in
“Quid ais? quum intelllexeras

I'd consilium Ι cripere, crir non Ι dixti extemplo Pamphilo f ”
(And. iii. 2. 87.)
