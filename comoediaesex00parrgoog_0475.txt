398 INTRODUOTION ΤΟ PHORMIO.

Antipho got into a similar serape, which had every different end, but
one quite as embarrassing ιο him. For when Chremes reached Lemnos
he found that his birds had flown. Phanium and her mother, tired of
waiting for him, now that Phanium was grown up, had started for
Athens in search of him, with their nurse Sophrona. They inquire
every where for Stilpho, but no such person is to be heard of, aud they
arc reduced to great distress‚ in consequence of which the mother dies
soon after their arrival. By a singular chance Antipho happens at this
moment ιο see Phanium, as she is lamenting the death of her mother,
and falls desperately in love with her at first sight. He goes to
Sophrona, who will not consent to allow any acquaintance but on cou-
dition of marriage; and Antipho will sacrifice himself to a girl without
a penny rather than lose her altogether. But how is the maffiage to
be brought about without exposing Antipho to his father’s most serem
censure? It is managed in the following way. Phormio, a parasite,

who seems to have been under considerable obligations to these young
’ men in the way of good living (see ii. 2. 22), gives him this advice.
There is an Athenian law, that orphans should be taken iu menlage
or portioned out by their nearest relat-ion. He will pretend to be
Phaninm's guardian, and will bring an action against Antipho, ss her
nearest relation, and as Antipho has no money he will of couno be
obliged ιο marry her. Sc Demipho will not be able to say s word.-

The plan succeeds to admiration. Phormio gains his suit, and Antipho
immediately marries Phanium. He is devoted to his wife, but lives in
continual dread of his father's return3 and is quite as wretched in
consequence of his success as Phaedria is because his ease is hopeless.
At this point (Act i. Sc. t) the aetion of the play commences.

Demipho comes back from Cilicia, and immediately hears the unwel-
come news that his son has married a pauper3 and he at once attacks
Geta, Antipho having made a hasty retreat, who defends himself as best
he can, and begins the second plot which they hare in hand for
obtaining money for Phaedria, who is now driven ιο the last extremity5
for Dorio has given him notice that if thirty minae are not forthcoming
by the next day, Pamphila, the music girl, will be sold. Geta pretends
therefore that Phormio will be very glad ιο take Phanium off their
- hands if they will make it worth his while to do so; for he has certain
dehtr, and is already under an engagement ιο marry a lady who will
bring him a sufficient portion to enable him to clear them off. He
must therefore have thirty minae, and he will settle the matter for them.
After some trouble the affair is arranged. Phormio receives the money,
and at once carries it off tc Phaedria, who purchases his Pamphila at
once, and is made supremely happy; while poor Antipho is more
wretched than ever, and accuses Geta of blundering stupidity in thus
