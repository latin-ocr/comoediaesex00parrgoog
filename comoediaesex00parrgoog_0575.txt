498 ἹῈΒΕΝΟΕ AND THE NEW commit.

exemples will be sufficient to prove a general resemblance, which is all
· thetis contended for, and which, without any additional testimony, will

not warrant us in referring these fragments to the Συιαποθνὴσκοπες.
'l'bus in Diphili Feb. Incert. Fragm. xv. we bave:

Ὅστις γὰρ aalide αὑτὸν οὐκ αἰσχύνεται
ουνειδόθ αὐτῷ φαῦλα διαπεπραγμένῳ
πῶς τόν γε μηδὲν εἰδότ’ αἰσχυνθήσεται;
which reminds usin some degree of the following lines of Terence:

“ Nam qui mentiri aut fallere insuerit patrem, aut
Audebit, tanto magis audebit cacteroe.”
(Adelph. i. 1. 30, 31.)

Again, Fragm. xxi:
Ἀνδρὸς φίλου καὶ συγγενοῦς καὶ οἰκίαν
αὑτοῦ νομίζειν δεῖ τὸν ὀρθῶς omrai).
Compare Adelphi r. 3. 17, 18:

“ -— Vetus verbum hoc quidem est
Communia esse amicorum inter se omnia,”

on which a common Greek proverb, κοινὰ τὰ τῶν φίλων, is quoted from
Menander. See note.

ΤΙια following fragment (Diph. Fab. Ine-ert. xvii.):

‘Os δ’ οὔτ’ ἐρυθριᾶν οἶδεν οὔτε δεδιέναι,

τὸ πρῶτ’ ἁπάσης τῆς ἀναιδείας ἔχει,
is given again as Fragm. clxxiii. of the uncertain plays of Menander;
which is to some extent a proof that there wau a play of Diphilus
resembling one of Menander’s. And we are perhaps, from Terence’s
account of his play noticed abore, justified in concluding that these two
similar plays were the Ἀδελφοι and the Συναποθνῄσκοντες.

Passing to the ascertained fragments of the Ἀδελφοι of Menander, wc
find some plain parallels to passages in Terence’s play, which are placed
here in the order of the Latin Comedy.

Adelphii. 1. 18:

“ — Quod fortunatum isti putant,
Uxorem nunquam habui.”

Menander, ragin. *raca a:
Ὦ μακάριόν μ’ [ὅστις] γυναῖκ’ οὔ λαμβάνω,

according to Mainake‘s restoration. In my note on tbe passage of
Terence Ι have read, ὦ μακάριόν με. οὔ γυναῖκα λαμβάνω.
