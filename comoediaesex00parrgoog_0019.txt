his party at supper. After the mccl was over, the remainder of the
play was read, was highly approved by his audience, and was recom-
mended ιο the Aediles by Caecilius. He wrote aud exhibited six

comedies, in the following order:

'Phe Andria. 'l'he Eunuchus.
ι The Hecyra. The Phormio.
The Heautontimorumenos. 'Phe Adelphi.

Of these the ‘Eunuchus’ issaid by some ιο have been acted twice in
the same day; and the ‘Phormio’ to have been acted four times iu the
sama year (but see the notes on the Inscriptions ιο those plays). In
consequence of the success of his plays he was accused of receiving the help
of his noble friends in their composition ; acharge which will be consi·
dered more fully hercafter. Of the rest of his life little is known. He
is said to have left Rome in the thirty-fifth year of his age, on a visit ιο
Greece3 avoyaga from which he never returned. The following lines,
alluding ιο this event, are attributed ιο Volcatius:

“ Sed ut Afer sex populo dedit comoedias,
Iter hinc in Asiam fecit; navem cum semel
Conscendit visus nunquam est 3 sio vita vacat.”

He is supposed to have been lost st sea on his return to Italy 3 and with
him perishcd translations of several comedies of Menander which he had
made during his visit to Athens. Another account is that he died at
Stymphalusin Arcadia of an illncss brought on by grief for the loss of
those pieces which he hod sent before him to Rome. At the time of his
death he is said ιο have possessed some property on the Appian Road
near Villa Martis. One daughter survived him, afterwards the wife of a
Roman senator. 'l'he writer of the following lines, summing up the
brief narrative of his life, says that he died in extreme poverty, and that
his visit to Graece was occasioned by the loss of his property. 'l'helines
are attributed ιο Porcius:

“Dum lasciviam nobilium et fuoosas laudes petit;
Dum Africani vocem divinam inhiat avidis auribus;
Dum ad Furium se coenitare et Laelium pulchrum putat3
Dum se amari ab hisce credit, crebro in Albanum rapi

Ob florem aetatis suae3 ipsus sublatis rebus ad sumniam
Inopiam redactus est.
