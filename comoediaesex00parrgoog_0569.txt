EUNUCHUS.

The ‘Eunuchus’ of Terence was taken partly from the ‘Eunuchus’

partly from the ‘Colux,' of Menander, which latter play had apparently
been imitated by N aerius and Plautus before our author. See Prol. ad

Eunucb. notes ou vv. 25. 27. In this instance the two plays os Me»,
nauder must bave been altogether different iu substance and plot-the
‘Eunuchus’ was probably entirely devoted ιο the plot by which Chaerea
obtains possession ol Pamphila, to Phaedria’s love affair with Thais,
and the interventiou of Chremes ιο clear up the mystery hanging about
Pamphila; with the ludiorous revenge of Pythias aud the perplexity of
the outwitted Parmeno. These materiale composa the greater portion

’ ol Terence's play, and were, no doubt, the whole of Menander’s. The

character of Antipho was introduced by Terence himself ιο serve as a foil
to Chaerea. See Donatus on iii. 4.1. The ‘Colax’ would give the cho·
racters of Thraso (or Bias iu Menander, see Meinelse, ΚΟΛΑΞ i.) and
Gnatho (or Strutbias); and was particularly devoted ιο tbe sketch os the
Braggadocio and the Parasite. Terence introduces these two characters
into the plot ol the ‘Eunuchua’ connecting them with Thais. This
portion of the play consiste of net ii. Scene ις aet iii. Scenes l and 2;
not iv. Scene 7; Act v. Scenes 7 und 8: certainly, with the exception
of Chaerea's adventures, the most spirited part of the play, and in point
of humour among the best scenes remaining ιο ns in Latin Comedy.
The fragments which have been preserved of the ‘Eunuchus’ of
Menander are very lew. The most lengthy extract from this play is
found in Persius, Sat. v. 161, dec, where it appears that Chaerestratus,
Chrysis, and Davus were the names of the characters which appear in
Terence as Phaedria, Thais, and Parmeno. This is not a great matter.
The opening words of the play,

“Quid igitur faciam?” (Eun. i. 1. 1,)

are said by Donatus to be a translation of Menander’s εἶτα τί ποιήσω
and the following words, be remurlrs, should be read ‘Non eam ne nunc
quidemf' without any break, if we would keep close to Menander’s
original. On this hint Meiueke has restored (conjecturally) the frag·
ment thus: '

sira τί ποιήσω μὴ προσέλθοι μηδὲ νῦν,
aagendam (aa. Fragm. i.)
