alluding not merely to the opposition ol tha moment, hat to something
which had happened more than onee; to some opposition which had
attended the representation of previous plays. The langaaage is very
general, and in speaking ol hii enemy he seems to assume that tha
hostility existing between them was already notorious. Againinthe first
Prologue to the ‘Hecyra‘ (v. 8), the writer says:

“Alias cognostis ejas: quaeso hanc nunc noscitc.”

Now the ‘Hecyra' was brought sorward sor representation a second.
time in aa. 165, the year after the representation ol the ‘Andria'
But, as I have remarked in the note on that passage, these words were
perhaps spoken at the last representation bnt one os the ‘Hecyra' in
ac. 160, in which case the speaker would have been able to allude to all
the existing plays of, Terence except the ‘Adelphi’ The case of the
‘Andria’ is more difficult, sor we cannot refer the Prologue to any re·
presentation oi the play after its first appearance. In this Prologue, as
well asin those of all the plays, with the exception os that belonging to
the ‘Hecyra’ the poet is evidently introducing his comedy for the first
time to his audience. We cannot therefore account sor the language of
this Prologue as we can for that of the Prologue to the ‘Hecyra’ by
supposiug it to have been spoken on tho occasion of asecond or third
appearance of the play. We must then either suppose that other plays
existed ol which we have no trace, perhaps youthsul efforts, which sell
into obscurity aster the more mature productione os Terence had become
popular; or, to avoid such a gratuitous hypothesis, we must have re·
course to some explanation which shall derive probability from the
internal evidence of Terence's prologues. Such a pieoe ol evidence pre·
sente itsell to us in the Prologue to tha ‘Eunuchus’ Terence says,
speaking of Lavinius:
' “— Quam nuno acturi sumus -

Menandri Eunuchum postquam Aediles emerunt,

Perfecit sibi ut inspiciendi esset copia.

Magistratus quum ibi adessent occepta est agi

Exclamat furem non poetam fabulam

Dedisse, et nihil dedisse verborum tamen.'’
(vv. 19-24.)

lt appears from this passage that Lavinius had obtained from the
Aediles permission to read over the ‘Eunuchus’ besore it was rehearsed
