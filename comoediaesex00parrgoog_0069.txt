“ Ρο Ι eta dederit Ι quae sunt adoles Ι centium?
an iambic tetrameter:

“ Dum Ι tempus ad eam Ι rem tulit sivi Ι animum ut expler'et suum ;”

but in the case of the iambic tetrameter catalectic he preserves the
arrangement of iambic dipodiae:

u-'u-ivLu-lu-'u-iu-'v
“ Nam si remitltent quippiam Ι Philfimemm Ι doloree.'’

Iambic verses, however, have their own arrangement of dicandae, or
'metron and it is more convenient in speaking os these verses to com·
mence the line with an iambic measure (υ ,ν u ,), and to measure the
verse bya successiones these messuras rather than by trochaic. The
system adopted by Bentley and others involves a breaeh of the lawa of
caesura; some having even supposed that in iambic and trocheis verse
there is a legitimate caesura at the end of every dipodia. Of iambic
verses we have the following kinds used in Terence:

I. Iannrc Tarnsnsrnn Oaranserm, called also sepimus and
Ooms'cae Quadratus (as being confined to Comedy⁵); consisting of four
iambic dipodise, deficient by one syllable.

υ-ὐ-Ιό-υ-Ιυ-ὐ-Ιυ-ὐ
The Canauna in this metro falls at the end of the fourth foot, which
must always be an iambus.
The iambis septenarius appears to have been conceived as osyaartetua

or composed of two independent parts; thus

The fourth foot is therefore treated as strictly ss the end of an iambic
verse. Accordingly we find many verses in Plautus and Terence in
which the fourth foot is terminated by a short syllable, as at the end
of a line, or where there is an Hiatus after the fourth foot. The follow·
ing lines from Plautus an'd Terence exemplify this peculiarity:

· “Sed si tibi vil ginti minae ΙΙ argenti prolferdntuff'
“Tuo nos vocalbis nomine? ΙΙ Libertus non Ι patrdnoal” ’
“ Id potins vilginti minae ΙΙ hic insunt in Ι crumena.”
“Etsi scio ego Ι Philiimena ΙΙ meum jris esse ut Ι te cdgnm.'’
