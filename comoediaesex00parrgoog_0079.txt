commences. Simo determines to tell Pamphilus that heis to be married
to Philumena, hoping to place him in adilemma; 10111 he refused, then
he could tahe him severely to tash; ifhe consented, then Chremes might
be gained over, and after all the match might tahe place. Accordingly
he tells Pamphilus by the way in the Forum that he is to be married
11111 very day. Pamphilus returns home in amazement3 but is met by
Mysis, servant 01 Glycerium, who revives his old affection forher mistress.
Davus meanwhile 11111 the whole matter 10 the bottom; finds that the
marriage is apretence, and accordingly recommends Pamphilus to humour
his father 10 the utmost, and express his entire readiness 10 marry
11 soon as he pleases. At the same time he is to keep up his intimacy
with Glycerium, that Chremes may be as shy 01 his connexion as he is
now. Meanwhile there is 1 by·pl0t 11 worlr. One Charinus, a friend
01 Pamphilus, who isin love with Philumena, hears with dismay that
she is 10 be married 10 his smeud, aud urges him 10 (10 all in his power
to defer the marriage 11 possible. So affairs stand when Glycerium is
brought tobed 01 1 son, Simo, who hears what is going on, imagining, and
being confirmed by Davus in the belief, that this is merely an artifice
01 Glycerium and her friends 10 prevent Pamphilus’ marriage. He
accordingly again treats with Chremes on the subject 01 the marriage
01 Pamphilus and Philumena, and extorts 1 reluctant consent. 'Phia
places Davus in 1 great strait; for Pamphilus now reproaches him
with his untoward advice, which has got hini into this mischief; and
Charinus too is indignant to the last degree at the treachery 01 Pam·

and contrives that Chremes shall hear its history from Mysis. 'I'his¹
causes 1 fresh rupture between Chremes and Simo. Ι11111111 moment
there arrives anative 01 Andros, Crito, next of hin 10 Chrysis, who
has come to Athens to claim her property. He clears up the previous
history 01 Glycerium, who is joyfully recognized as Chrsmes' daughter,
and all parties are made happy; Simo being with some difficulty gained
overto forgive past offences, and to receive his aon and Davus into favour

again.
