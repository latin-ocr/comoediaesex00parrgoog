xxxiv INTRODUOTION.

“ Quonddquidem illam a me distrahit necessitas.'’
(Hec. iii. 5. 42.)

“ Tum equidem istuc os tuum impudens videre nimium vellem.”
(Eun. iii. 5. 49.)

’ “ Equidem hercle nescio. Vin scire? At ita mc servet Jupiter?
(Phorm. v. 3. 24.)

The following notices may conclude this head:

vio. “ [lhectdrm sed vi, et eia pervulgata patrum.¹’
(Heaut. i. 1. 49.)

cide. “Τ9,911691999 cst diei, cide sis ne quo hinc abeas ldngius.''
(Heaut. 1. 2. 38.)

Compare Heaut. iv. 8. 30. Adelph. ii. 2. 31. Hec. iii. 5. 34. The
same contractiora occurs in videre and videt.-

, redi. “Nam hercle etiam hoo restat. Illuc quaeso rc'dr' quo
coepisti, aeschine? (Adelph. ii. 1. 36.)
“ Concaluit: quid visi' Re'di, redi.'’
(Heaut. ii. 3. 108.)
Ι9 119 latter quotation we have an instance 91 the change of pronun·
ciation before noticed in the case of mayie. Ati 19 very frequently
monosyllublc. See Hecyra iv. 1. 42 ².
3. When ‘ u’ is followed or preceded by another vowel.
The common instanoes 91 ejuq trojae, capae, deo, have been already
notioed; nor need we here instance such cases as ‘studuerit’ ‘voluerit,’

‘cubuerit’ ‘potuerit’ and generally speaking all tenses of verbs in
which the final consonant of the root is followed by ‘ u.'

duint is not contracted'in Terence, except once in the compound
perduint .·
“At 16 111 Deaeque perducire cum isto odid Lache‚”
(Hec. i. 2. 59)

and in this passage this reading 19 991 quite certain, though there is
the best authority for the text as here given. The following less
common words may be added here:

² In some 91 my notes 1 have followed Ritschl and others 19 speaking 91 ¹ abi,' ‘roga'
⁴ manc‚' ⁴ jube,' occ, as 11 they vvere prouounoed ⁸ ⁹. Itis more consistent, however, with
the general custom 91 Terence to treet them, as 1 have here done, as monosyllables. The
student will easily find very many more exemplos of the use 91 each 91 these words.
