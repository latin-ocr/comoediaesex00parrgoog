INTRODUCTION. xiii

Itaque a conspectu omnium abiit in Graeciam, in terram ultimam. -
Mortuus estin Stymphale, Arcadiae oppido: nihil Publius

Scipio profuit, nihil ei Laelius, nihil Furium

Tres per idem tempus qui agitabant nobiles facillime.

Eorum ille opera ne domum quidem habuit conductitiam

Saltem ιιι esset quo referret obitum domini servulus.'’

These are the few facts which have been recorded of the life and career of
Terence. We can only endeavour to fill up the blank by conjecture. I
may, however, here offer a few remarks ou the narrative as it is handed
down ιο ιιι.

The story of his servitude is open to considerable objection. With this
has been mixed up another tale, that he walkedin the triumphalprocession
of Scipio Africanus after his return from the conquest of Carthsge‚ ιι a
hberatedRoman citizen. But, setting asidethe historical anachronism of

this story, it seems most probable that the Terentius here referred to
was one Terentius Ouleo, a noble Roman, οι senatorian rank, who was
among the many Roman captives brought back by Scipio from captivity
ιι Carthage. We cannot certainly say whether Terence was a Car·

thaginian at all. His eminence as a Latin writer is not indeed inconsistent -
with an humble or foreign origin3 but the feet of his possessing property
of some extent, and the connexion formed by his daughter, seem ιο
go against the common story of his extreme poverty. We can hardly
suppose that his literary success was ιο great as ιο put himin possession
of a handsome fortune, or ιο enable him to make any great purchases of
land. The ‘Eunuchus’ was considered to fetch a remarkable sum,
eight thousand sesterces, equivalent to about ³:64 1οι. os our money,
aud at this rate his plays could not have afforded him every ample
livelihood. We should rather conclude from the recorded events of· his
life, as far as their value can he estimated, that he must have been in a
position ιο make literature hie profession, and ιο follow his profession
with a sense of his duty to his art, rather than ιιι a mere means of
making money. The tone which he takes in all his Prologues ιι ιιιι of
an independent author, who feels himself above the necessity of courting
popularity, and who is determined ιο write according to his own views
of poetry. He complains that his enemies sought to condemn him to
idleness and obscurity; buthe does not once hint ιι any pecuniary loss
to himself from their opposition. and this view of his pecuniary
