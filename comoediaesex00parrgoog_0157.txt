which he makes his escape. This event causes the greatest consternation
in the household; and is no less distressing to Thais, who finds her plan
for restoring Pamphila to ber relations thus awkwardly frustrated.
For in the meantime she bas obtained some interviews with Chremes,
the brother of Pamphila, and has nearly identified Pamphila when the
catastrophe comes to ber knowledge. Phaedria, too, is much discon-
certed at discovering that his present has worked so much mischief.
All parties, in fact, are at their wit's end, with the exception of
Chaerea, who, upon discovering Pamphila's history, makes the best
amends he can by undertaking to marry her. Pythias meanwhile,
’ Thais' maid, pays off old scores by driving Parmeno to divulge the
whole matter to Laches, father of Chaerea and Phaedria. The result
isof course a happy explanation on all sides. Thais is taken under
Laches' protection, and continues her intimacy with Phaedria. Chaerea
aud Pamphila rnany. Parmeno is forgiven hy his grateful young master:
and the only person who suffers is the unfortunate Thraso, who is beaten
clean off the field, and is only too glad to submit to be the perpetual
butt of these young sparks, ou condition that he shall be allowed to
be oue in their parties, and thus still enjoy the society of Thais.
‚ This is the outline of the play, which gives a very lively and amusing
action. But the most admirable feature is the manner in which some of
the subordinate parts are worked out. The bye-play between Pythias
and Parmeno is admirable. Tho character of the Parasite as drawn in
Act II. scene ii. is admirable, and striking from its novelty after the
hackneyed ideal which is presented to us in all the plays of Plautus.
No less admirable is the Braggadocio of Act III. soene i, the features
of the character being the sameas those of the Miles Gloriosus of
Plautus, except that Terence with greater humour makes Thraso prouder
of his wit than of his military exploits. The scene in which Thraso is
represented as attacking Thais in her house (Act IV. scene vii.) is
highly ridiculous, and reminds one more strongly than any passage of
Terence of the free humour of Aristophanes. We cannot wonder that
the Eunuchus should have been the most popular of all Terence's plays:
for here there is the nearest approach to the “Plautini sales,’‘ which
vvere the true Roman comedy. It is said to have been purchased by
the Aediles for the sum of 8000 sesterces (above 641. lOs. sterling), tho
- largest sum which had been given for any play. The leading incident of
the plot makes it unfit for the modern stage: but when we say this we
say all that can be said against the play. The execution is highly de·
licata, even in the famous scene which describes the successful issue of
Chaerea's scheme. The play is said hy the author of the Life of Terence
to have been acted twice in one day: and no doubt it was acted on
more than oue occasion.
