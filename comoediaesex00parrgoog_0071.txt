lxiv INTRODUO'I'ION.

Terence has the caesura after the syllable following the second mea-
sure. The following lines are e fair example of his metre:
“Hand similis sirglo est virginum Ι 0οξ01000000, quas Ι matres
student
Demissis humerlis esse 01001Ιο ξ pectore ut Ι gracilie sient.
Si qua 601 habitilor paulo pugil Ιο00 000οξοῑ001, de Ι ducunt cibum:
Tametsi bona est Ι natura, redldunt ξ 0100100Ιο Ιιὶ00000.”
(Eun. ii. 3. 21—24.)

“ Quam iniqui sunt Ι patres in 000οΙ00 ξ 010101οο0001Ιο0 jndices,
Qui aequum esse cens Ι 001 060 0 puerl is ξ ilico Ι nasci senes,
Neque illerum affinles esse rerlum ξ quas fert adollescdntia.
Erana libidlind moderentlur ξ minc quae est 000 Ι quae olim
fuit.'’ (Heaut. ii. 1. 1—4.)

We meet with a few verses in Terence in which there is a slight
departure from the regular form, arising from a neglect 01 the caesura.
In these ceses the iambus of the fourth foot is replaced by 0 spondee or
some equivalent foot.

ΙΙΙ. Ιο000οΤ0000000(υου, Ι u-‘u- Ι μμ).

This metae is the staple 01 Terence’s plays. They all commence with
it; and it is generally used in 011 descriptive passages, with one or two
remarkable exceptions, es in Eunuchus iii 5, end Hecyra iii. 8. This
lindos verse is 100 familior to require any criticism here. Terence, as
011 Roman pects, allows himself more licence then the Greek tragedinns,
but 001 more than the poete 01 the New Comedy. If the student will
bear in mind what has been said 00 the pronunciation of the Latin
languege‚ he will hnve 00 difficulty in any of Terence's iambic trimeters.

We now pass 10 the shorter forms of iambic verse used by Terence.

Taking the iambic tetrameter catalectic 00 the integral line, we find

thet itis divisible into two segmenta, 00 iambis dimeter, end 00 iambis

dimeter 0010100110. 1 2

υ-ὐ-Ιυ-ὐ-ΙΙυ-ῑυ-Ιυ-ὐ

Iambic dimeter. Iambic dimeter catalectio.
'these are used by Terence 00 clausulae. Of these we have, first:

IV. Ismaro Drnnrra (o ,ν υ , Ι u .t u ..).

· 01 this we have exemplos in the following lines, taken from the
‘Andria' and ‘Eunuchus :¹

“ Verdbar querolum evaderet? (and. i. 2. 5.)
