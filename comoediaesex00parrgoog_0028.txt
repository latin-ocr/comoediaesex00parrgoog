The story gains in cimnmstantiality in the hands of Nepos and Mem·
mins, and sofar loses in probability. The mora attentively the whole
tale is considered, the less likely does it seem. A caresul consideration
os Terence’s plays leads us to the conclusion that they are the produc· '
tion of a writer who was not only thoroughly educated, but had a oon·
metent theory oi dramatic composition, and ventured to alter and adopt
‚ the existing materiale of the Greekcomedy, so as to bring thern into
bis system. Add to this the remarkable purity ot' the language of
Terence, which overleaps the whole interval between himself and Octul-
lns-for in that interval we find nothing to compare with our author—-
and we cannot without a violent inconsisteney suppose that all this was
the result os the patchwork contributione of two or three dilettanti
noblemen, who used the name of their client es a soreen in the indul·
genoe of their love os literary adventure. The whole story is simply
one οἰ those pieres oi literary gosaip which gain credit from two causes;
pmtly because the contemporaries and nearer followers of such a writer
aa Terence are apt to be jealous of the author who has no other certain
history than the paramount beauty and success of his works, and are
therefore glad to shift bis praise to other shoulders; and partly because,
when· an author leaves no history but his worhs, there is a great tempta
tion to make a history for his worhs, and to connect them with any
great names who may bave happened to be bis contemporaries. Laelius
and Scipio had as much claim to the authorship os these plays ss Bacon
has to that of the plays os Shakespear03 and yet we have seen within
this year a serious attempt to father ‘Shakeepeare' on the authores the
‘N ovum Organon.' Terence himself alludea to this charge more than
once:

‘⁴ Turn quod malevolus vetus poeta dictitat,
Repente ad studium huno se applicasse musicum,
Amicum ingenio fretum, baud natura sua,
Arbitrium vestrum, vestra existimatio
Valebit,’'
(Heauton Prolog. 22-26,)

and again: ο

“ Nam quod isti dicunt malevoli, homines nobiles
Eum adjutare, assidueque una scribere;
..Quodillimalediotum vehemens esse existimant
