“ eyry of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question, and
are most tyrannically clapped for¹t‚¹¹ to the stage oi Shakespeare.

The characters which appear in the plays of Terence are in the main
horrowed l'rom the ordinary repertory of the Ncw Comedy. These
characters are well described iu Schlcgel’s Lectums ou Dramatic Art s
and Literature (Leot. xiv.); but without any particular reference to
their treatment by Terence. In the Classical Museum, vol. vii, there
isa good article on Bitschl’s Plautus, containing among other useful
matter an interesting general parallel between Plautus and Terence;

and a discussion of the characters of their plays-in which, however, ,

there is little novelty. Itis true that, generally speaking, the characters

of the New Comedy passed on to Plautus and Terence, just as from³
thern they descended to Ariosto, (who endeavoured in his acrei sdracciols'

to imitate ,the iambic trimeter,) Aretino, and Metastasi03 but if we

examine them carefully we shall find the widest differenee of treatment.

Ihsvc in the notes on these plays taken many occasions of remarking

upon the originality of some of Terence's characters. I may refer the ’
reader to the treatment of the characters of the braggadocio aud the
parasite in the ‘Eunuchua’ of Phormio, of Parmeno in the ‘Hecyra'
as compared with the slaves in the other plays. Indead every slave that
appears in Terence has his distinctiva marks. Davus, in the ‘Andria'
isimpudent and craity, never at a loss iu any perplexity, and comes off
finally triumphant. Syrus in the ‘Heautontimorumenos’ resemblcs
him in general character, only that he is even more cralty, and carries
out his plots with greater skill and impunity. His namesake in tho
‘adelphi' is perhaps one ol the most amusing specimens of his tribe
in Terence’s plays. His unblushing effrontes-y in lying on every neees-
sary occasion, and the impudence with which he satiricos Demea to his
face, give him a ffistinct character. The Parmeno of the ‘Eunuchus’ is
aplottes by nature, but not by intention. He is alarmed when Phaedria
adopta and acts upon his scheme; and his timidity becomes simple
despair when at the end of the play Pythias retaliates on him witha
dreadful story of the punishment of his young master. His namesake
in the ‘Hecyra’ ia simply a sententious busybody, of no use whatever
in the action of the play, and introduced merely for the sake of the in·
formation which he can communicate respecting his master. Geta, in
the ‘Phormio’ is also a subordinate character3 and his only merit is
that he is aealous for his pupils, and utterly regardless of his duty to his
old master. The part usually played hythe slave, of deceiving the
