INTRODUC'I’ION. xxxvii

“ Student ficere: in appardndo consumdnt diem.”
(Adelph. w. 7. 2.)

In the class of words noticed above in which ‘v' was the distinguish-
ing letter we found that in contractiori the semivowel passed into its
vowel sound, as coac = cau. In the present instance ‘u’ has osten the
force oi‘w‚’ ae dcco = daco, or volucrit = cecinerit, while in other cases,
aa in that of studet, the consonant disappears‚ and the ‘u’ round is
retained.

4. In the case of ‘c’ followedby a vowel the same contraction is
found, and here the ‘e' must approach nearly to the sonnd of ‘y,‘ there
being such a resemblance as there ia between our own words ⁴ eor’ and
‘year,’ which are scarcely to be distingrnshed in the ordinary pronun·
ciation. The following instanoes may be noticed os the different cases
and genders of ‘ idem ι’
