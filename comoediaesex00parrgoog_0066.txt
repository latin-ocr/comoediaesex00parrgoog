INTRODUO'I'ION. lix

Keepiug these considerationem mind, I now go on to give a brief
aketoh os the various matres used in Terence.

Taking the paroxytone dissyllable as thebaeis of metrieal measure, we
may arrange the various measures aa follows, using for simplieity the
ordinary notation.

a. Trochaio.

β. Iambie.

γ. Grebia.

δ. Autispaatio. ’ υ -’ J. u
ε. Bacehiae.

In addition to these we have once used in Terence a mixed measure
ealled choriambio (a υ υ Δ). Ι

Troehaie and iambis verses are lo be measured hy dspods'ae, or matres,
each consisting of a double foot: the primary rule (iu verses where the
quantity of syllables isdistinotly marked, as in Greek) being that in a
trochaie lina the first, third, fifth, aud serenth feet must be trochees; in
an iambis line the second, fourth, aiath, and eighth must be iambio'.
cretio and baaohiao measures are ‚often referred to the paeonio mea·
sures3 hut it ia clear that a cretio is atroohaio metra deficient by oue
syllable. The baeebiac is merely an improvement on the amphibraoh
(υ ,, υ), by iuereaaiug the weight of the final syllable.

I. Taocuaro Marnas.

I. Taocumo Tarmarua Caranuorro, called by the Romans Quad-

ratae or Septenariua. This verse consiste of four troobaio matres, of
which the lastis deficient by one syllable. ,

· ι’- ...chamanto-cles,-

The following li es are a gold example (ΙΙ this kind of verse: Ι

ι ΒΙΙἪΙΜΙΠῙ quid porto Ι Sed ubi inveniam Ι Pamphilum,

bt me m in quo Ι uduo eat adimam atique expleam animum]
gaddio? ' ’
Laetus est nelseio quid. Nihil est: Ι ndndum haee reaoilvit mala.''
⁹ (And. ii. 2. 1-3.)

“ Nr‘ruquam ita quiequam Ι hene subducta Ι ratione ad vitlem fuit
Quin res, aetas Ι (rsus semper Ι (aliquid apportlet novi;
inquireremus, Ι ar illa quae te Ι seire eredas Ι neseiaa3
Et quae tibi publiris prima in Ι experiendo ut Ι τόριιᾱὶθε.”

(Adelph. v. 4. 1-4.)
