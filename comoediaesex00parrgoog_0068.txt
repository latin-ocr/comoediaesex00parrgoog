INTRODUOTION. lxi

The prerailing usage was to terminate each metro with a word. For
the sake of variety this rule is frequently departed from3 with this pro·
vision, that when a word is divided between two metros, the accented
syllable falls in the latter of the two, as

“ Misera? nam audilrisse vocem Ι pueri risus est Ι vagientis?
(Hac. iv. 1. 2.)
“ Thais ego jamldddum hic adsum. ΟΙ mi (lhremes te ipsum Ι
expectabam? (Eun. ir. 6. 5.)

ΙΠ. Taocanro umam Caratacum. Thiavensis nothing more 1
than the latter half ofa trochaic septenarius (a u - u Ι ,ν u ,).

It ia sometimes used by Terence as one of the forms of the clausulae,
or shorter verses mixed with others ‘of the same kind, and generally
capable of being read us a continuation os the matre. These clausulae
arc either iambic or trochaic. Of the trochaic the following are ex·
amples: '

“ Quidaisquum intellldreraal’ (And. iii. 2. 37.)
“ Quicum loquitur Ι lilius ?” ι (Heaut. i. 2„ 4.)
)

“ Qudd si abesset Ι longius? (Adelph. iv. 1. 8.

“ slnde niihpayilildm pictam ?'' (Phorm. v. 1. 2.)

“ Ego istam invitis Ι dmnibus.’' (Adelph. ii. 1. 4.)

“ Dicam, non aedelpdl scio.” (Hec. iv. 1. 5.)

“ Proh Deum atque hominium fidem.” (And. i. 5. 10.)
IV. Taocnarc Mououunra Oaranrcrrc, equivalent to the final seg·

ment of the trochaic septenarius (J, υ ,). It occurs sometimes jn
exclamatione, as in Eun. ii. 3. 1: “ Occidi.” ,

V. Tsocnmc Monouurnn Acaranncr103 as (a v , υ).
“ D6rio audi.” (Phorm.¹ iii. 2. 1.)

ΙΙ. Ianam Marnas.

An iambic mammo, as hae been shown above (p. lix), differs from
trochaie in being preceded hyan marmio (u Ι ,ν u ,). Accordingly
iambic verse is by some critica treated as derived from trochaic by the
addition of an unaccented syllable at the commencement of the verse.
