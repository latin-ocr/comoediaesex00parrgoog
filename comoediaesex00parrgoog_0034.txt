11. THE machaon AM> nuans 01⁴¹ TERENCE.

Conana naturally approaches much more nearly to common language
than any other kind of poetry. An Epio is made to be read, not spoken3
Tragedy and Lyric Poetry are raised above the level of ordinary con·
venatiom while in Comedy we hare afaithful reflexion of every-day lise,
manners, and language. And when we come to the Latin languoge, and
its pronunciation, as indicated by the practice of Terence, the value of this
common type of Comedy is heightened by the particular feature which
distinguishes the Eorum Comedy, the employment of a foreign, and olten
a highly artificial, metro. These two consideratione placed together en·
able us to form atolerably accurate judgment of the pronunciationof the
Latin language in the time of Terence. For on the one hand we hold it
sor certain that wherever it was possible Terence would keep closely to
the pronunciation, as well as to the conversatione] idiom, of ordinary
languag03 and the existence of mette in his plays enables usin most cases
to ascertain clearly what was the pronunciation of any particular word.
Τυ take an example. If we find that ‘meda’ with perhaps one or two⁸
exceptione (sce note on Hecyra v. 3. 32), is pronounced as a mono·

syllable, while ‘mido' (abl.) is invariably adissyllable (and this cau be ’

clearly ascertained by the metre), we hare so far a voluable hint for the
etymological use of these two words. And in the same waya careful
attention to the metro as well as to the sense will often enable us to
break through some supposed law of grammarians, which was made
without sufficient attention to these points. (See the instance of ‘ statim,¹
note on Phormio v. 3. 6.) And as the metre thus helps the pronuncia·
tion, so the pronunciation reacts on the metre. When we carry with us
to the Metres of Terence a clear estimato of the then existing Roman
pronunciation, we are able to disentangle his verses of many of the per-
plexities which commentatore hare often introduced into them. The
student who arrderstands that in ordinary pronunciation such a word as
‘habent’ was monosyllabic will not be reduced to the necessity of be-
lieving, with Bentley, that in the line
