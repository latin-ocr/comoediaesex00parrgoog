In determining the text os Terence we have almost as much
difficulty asin any classica] author. To pass from modern editions,
in which the student is puzzled to decide which is the ori-
ginal reading, and which the conjecture (for most modern editors
have more or less consistently followed Bentley's emendations);
even when we come to the comparatively pure and ancient
text we are not yet on certain ground. The difficulty of Terence’s
textis that it is too perfect. His plays have been so popular, and
so much in use as a text book, that it is impossible not to suspect
that in many cases, which we cannot now hope to discover, the
smooth corrections of schoolmasters and professorshave superseded
the native reading of the author. ¹So Ritschl says, “Omnino vix
ullam scenam esse fabularum Terentianarum puto in qua non ali- .
quid turbatum sit gravius, criticae artis medicinam etiam post
Bentleii curas expectans¹.'’ And the same uncertainty extends ‘
even to the oldest manuscript with which we are acquainted. A
careful examination of the whole text of Terence has convinced me
of the truth of another remark of Ritschl: “ N am in Terentio tam
aperta plurimis locis est quam in Plauto rara fuit correctricis
. manus opera in refingendis resarciendisque versibus consumpta,
eaque ex antiquiore aetate repetenda quam qua ipse Bembinus liber
scriptus est: longius autem a Terentiana integritate Bembinus
quam a Plautina Ambrosianus abest ’.'' Iwill here briefly men-
tion the materials which the Editor has at hand for the purpose of

fixing the text of Terence.

The¹ most important Manuseript is that which goosby the name of
the “ Baun1nn,'’ from its possessor, Pietro Bembo. It was corrected
and illustrated by Politian. It finally passed into the hands of
Fulvius Ursini, and by him was bequeathed to the Vatiean Library.
This Manaueript, with many others of good atamp, was used by Fatrn
in his edition of Terence, completed after his death by Victor (an.
