Rus abiit: illum curo unum: ille ad me attinet.
Quando ita vult frater, de istoc ipse viderit.

Sed quis illic est procul quem rideo? estne hic Hegio,
Tribulis noster? si satis cerno, is hercle eat: vah, 85
Homo amicus nobis J am inde a puero. Di boni!

N ac illiusmodi jam nobis magna civium

Penuria est: homo antiqua virtute ac lide.

Quam gaudeo ubi etiam hujus generis reliquias
Restare videol Ah, vivere etiam nunc libet.
Opperiar hominem hic, ut salutemet conloquar.
