heroon the general subject ol the literary position oi Terence, and
then to consider in detail the particular objections which were brought
against him.

Romeinthe time ol Terence eeemsto have been divided into two litorary
factione ;-·thosc who were for importing the elegant culture os Graece,
and transplanting its literature into the harder soil of Italy; and those
who held fast to the old ways, who loved the traditione oi the Cethegi,
and were for maintaining the rugged but vigorous nationality of Fes-
cennina and Saturnian yeme. As sor imitation ol* Greek models, that
could not be avoided. Plautus and his contemporaries had settled
that question3 but there existed in their transcripta no shallow vein
oi rough Roman wit, which maintained the rude independenee of
the natiim Camenae. The Scipiones and tha Laelii, Terenoe‘s friends
and patrona, were at the head of tha “young Bome” oi their day,
the movement party in politior, tha “ Greeks ’' in literature. They
would turn from the rugged lauguage and rude jests of tha Roman
poete to the exquisite diction and polished wit of the Greeks. To this
party Toronae was attached by social ties as well as b'y literary testes.
His humour was evidently ahin te that ol Menander, quiet and sparkling
just as Plautus reminds us more of the boisterous iun and audacity oi
Aristophanes. Ha bad set himself to work carefully in a finished style,
and to bring the Roman language intoa more strict uniformity with tha
laws ofrhythm than had been attained by any ol his predecessore. Το
him, no doubt, tha Greek languege was tbe perfection oi elegance and
retinement3 and be endeavoured to establish on the Roman stage a style
of Comedy that should in some measure possess these qualities. In this
attempt he would not only hara to contend with tha popular passion ior
excitament and with the existing toste which had been accustomed'to
coaraer foed, but he had to overcome the opposition oi apowerful and nu·
marona body. His opponente would be glad to attach themselves tojthe
conservatives of that day, the ‘⁶ Trojans,'’ to borrow a term from the bia·
tory of our own literature—the party represented by the Fabii and by
Cato. For we may be sure that the moro execrable poet a man was· the
morelustily he would denouncetheinnovator Terence3 themora he would
accuse him of being a bad copyist of foreign models; the more he would
decry his style as wanting in nervo and spirit. Such we may conceive
