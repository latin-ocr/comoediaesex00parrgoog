Graecis honis Latinas fecit non bonas.

Idem Menandri Phasma nunc nuper dedit;

Atque in Thesauro scripsit carmem dicere

Prius unde petitur aurum quare sit suum

Quam ille qui petit unde is sit thesaurus sibi,

Aut unde in patrium monumentum pervenerit.

Dehinc ne frustretur ipse se, aut sic cogitet,

“ Defunctus jam sum, nihil est quod dicat mihi ;'' 15
Is ne erret moneo et desinat lacessere.

Habeo alia multa quae nuno condonabitur3

Quae proferentur post, si perget laedere

Ita ut facere instituit. Quam nunc acturi sumus
