improbable, though not very important.

The Bembina copy has preserved in its Scholiast the following lines of

Menander:
Ἐξ ἱσταρίου δ’ ἐκρέματο φιλοπόνος πάνυ.
...... καὶ θεραπαινὶς ἦν μία·
αὕτη οννῦφαινε ῥυπαρῶς διακειμένη.

μέλλει καθευδήσειν.
(Meinehe, Post. Comic. rol. iv. p. 189.)

Zeune restores the line very differently. See note on Heaut. ii. 3. 10].
