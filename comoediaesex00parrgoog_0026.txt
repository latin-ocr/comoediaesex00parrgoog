incident in his plays, which were said tc owe their success entirely to
the merits of the actor (Prol. ιο Phormio). They seem ιο have been ’

brought forward successively3 probably as one failed ιο produce the ·

desired effect, recourse was had ιο another. We shall consider them
brielly iu order.

That which meets us first, and is noticed in the Prologne ιο the
‘Andria’ is the oberge of Plagiarism. This constituted the most im·
portant count of the indictment against Terence, aud he euswers it
with acare which shows that hc attached some weight ιο ἱι. If we
examine his answer, we find that the plays of Greek writers had all
along been considered aa the common property of Roman playwrigbts.
Naevius, Plautus, and Ennius, he says, had done the same; and he was
content ιο err in such good company. Moreover his opponent, Lavinius,
inconvicted of having used more than one of Menander’s plays at all
events, and very badly ιοο, making some capital blunders in law and
manners. Terence’s own case is fully considered in the ‘Excursns’ at
the end of this volume, in which I examine carefully the extent of his
,obligations ιο Menander and Apollodorus, and inquire how far we may
allow him ιο have had the originality of au independent poet. Here
Imay say generally that, as a matter of fact, he appears tc have used
the common Greek materials without scruple‚ accommodating them to
his own desigu. It does not follow from thiatbat he was a servile
translator. His faithful adherenee in the main to his originals, without
any introduction of Roman wit and manners, was, as has been shown,
the effect of his principles of composition. Το civiliae Roman teste by
Greek literature, he must avoid the mixture of the ordinary Roman
style. He is also accused of an imitation of his Roman predecessors.
'l'his he entirely disclaims, as in the Prologue to the ‘Eunuchus'
hunius had said:

“Colacem esse Naevi et Plauti veterem fabulam ς
Parasiti personam inde ablatam et militis.'’
’ (vv. 24, aa.)
He answers:

‘⁴ Si id est peecatum, peccatum imprudentia est .

Poetae; nou qui furtum facere studuerit.”
(vv. 27, 28.)

And again, after pointing ont that his obligations were really due ιο the
‘ Oolax’ of Menander, he adds:
