PREFAOE. vii

1565). It must be considered as the only one with any protension
ιο original authority, and aethe source from which most of the ex-
isting manuscripts have arisen. I have often in the following notes
had occasion to mention the readings of the Bembine Manuscript,
and it is a strong argument for its superior authority thatin many
emes it gives the more difficult reading, which has evidently been
misunderstood and altered by the transcriber of some other copy.
Ihave not had the opportunity of consulting the Manuscripts.
llany of their readings are quoted by the various editors of
Terence. The English copies have been collated by Here and
Bentley, not, however, withauy important results. Their text,
as quoted by Bentley, is generally bad where it deviates from the
common text. In deciding between conflicting readings, Ihave
frequently, aa will be seen in my Commentary, allowed the read·
ing of the Bembine Manuseript to settle a doubtful point.

Donavus is the most famous of the ancient commentatore on
Terence. He lived in the fourth century after Christ, aad was the
reputed master of Jereme. (See note on Hecyra ii. 1.4.) Many
have, however, entirely denied the genuineness of the commentary
which now passos under his name, but without sufficient reason.
The commentary is valuable both critically and exegetically, andI
have frequently found reason to prefer it to the opinion of later
editors. It is tc the commentatore what the Bembine Manuscript

is to the Codices, and may fairly be estimated in the same ’

manner. Often, no doubt, it contains traces of the genuine text;
as often, perhaps, it is wrong. In using it we must therefore call
in the aid of independent critical judgment. The Manuscripts of
Donatus arc confessedly very defective, and in many places hope·
lessly corrupt. Ihave always quoted from the edition of Zeune,
which presente the text of Donatus in the best shape.

Euonarnlus is supposed to have lived at the end of the sixth

century, aa). His commentary on Terence is merely rhetorical,
