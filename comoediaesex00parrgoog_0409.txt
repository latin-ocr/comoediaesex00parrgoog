HEOYRA.

Spe incerta certum mihi laborem sustuli.

Easdem agere coepi ut ab eodem alias discerem

N ovas studiose, ne illum ab studio abducerem.

Perfeci ut spectarentur. Ubi sunt cognitae,

Placitae sunt. Ita poetam restitui in locum

Prope jam remotum injuria adversarium

Ab studio atque ab labore atque arte musice.

Deterruissem facile ne alias scriberet.

Numquam agere licitum est3 ita eam oppressit calamitas.
Eam calamitatem vestra intelligentia

Sedebit, si erit adjutrix nostrae industriae.
