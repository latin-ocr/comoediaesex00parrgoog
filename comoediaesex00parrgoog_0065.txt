lviii INTRODUonw

pause at the Hiatus. The sense and rhythm run on evenly. Itis
possible that in tha first line we ought to read ‘quorsus’ in which oasa ·
the secent would sall thus, saving the Hiatus:

“ Misera timeo incertum hoc qudrsus accidat?
In Eunuchus iv. 3, 23, a simple alteration would be

“At pol ego amatores mulierum essa eor audieram maximos.”

In Hecyra v. 1. 19, wa may shift the Hiatus to volui, accenting thus:

“Mane nondum etiam diri id qudd volui. Hic nunc uxdrem
habet.”

In this last line I have adopted above Weise’s accentuation in his
Tauebnitc edition, which gives the words a better emphasis.

Marsus OF munuca.

, In the previous sections we have seen that tho chief peculiarities of
Latin pronunciation were (l) that all dissyllabic words were accanted on
the first syllable (paroxytonc), as were also all hyperdissyllabic words of
which the penultima was long; and that such hyperdissyllabic words as
bada short penultima were aocented on the antepenultimste (pro-
paroxytone), haring in effect, when arranged in a metrae secondary
aceent on the last syllable: (2) that in accordanee with the ordinary
laws of pronunciation many words in which there was an excess of un·
aecented syllables were shortened in delivery so as to sall under tha
ordinary laws of accentuation. Hence we should lay down, as an esseutial
requisito sor the study of Latin Comie Metres, that tho alternate distribu·
tion of secent determines the measure of words. Viewing the accented
syllables as half a measure, or, in more familiar language, half a foot, the
remainder of tbe word mustbe considered as the other half measure.
And therefore in treating of the trochaic and iambie matres, of which
Roman Comedy is chiefly composed, we should deal with each measure
asin effect a trochaio or an iambic measure, discarding altogether, aa lar
as this subject is concerned, if we wisb to speals correetly, all such
measure as tribraehs, anapaesta, daetyls‚ deo. A word, taken by itself,
may be a dactyl, an anapaest, or a tribrach, but, with reference tc tro·
chais and iambic verse, these names are inappropriste.
