'Phe testimony of Quinctilian is decisivo on¹ this point. He says
especially that the words coalesced, and that this made the pronun·
ciation sotter thanis every word had been pronounoed separately. See
ia 3. 36. With respect to the languuge οἰ Comedy he says, “Actores
comici neque ita prorsus ut nos vulgo loquimur pronunciant, quod
esset sine arte, nec procul tamen a natura recedunt, quo vitio periret
imitatio, sed mores communis hujus sermonis decore quodam scenico
exornant” (ii. 10.13). 'Pwo objecta, then, were before the aotor; to
give the ordinary pronunciation of the languag03 and at the same time
to marli to the audienoe the character of the metre. And if the common
practice in conversation wasto run the words, when possible, into one
another, we may expect to find the same practice in Terence. This usage
which we call, after Quinctilian (ix. 4. 36), ‘synaloepha’ is called by
Cicero ‘ Hiatus ι’ “ Habet ille quidem hiatus et concursus vocalium molle
quiddam ’' (De Oratore, c. 23). But Quinctilian's term is more
correct. ‘Hiatus’ properly describes the absence of ‘synaloepha’
und in this sense will be considered below. Itis curicus that Bentley,
in treating of this very peoidiarity in the Latin pronunciation which we
are now considering, uses the words “ Quin et ubi synaloephae vis
cessat, et vel vocalis quaepiam vel m finales non eliduntur, altera vocali
eas excipiente, ne hoc quidem in licentiis ponas3 qualia ista et plura
apud nostrum: mones pm' amcam md et aetate, πό uti acceperim, puae'
erat mortam dsim id officim Quiotms ono νέω lateam? He lays
down three rules for these words. (1) They are monosyllables. (2)
1f ending in a vowel, they are long. (3) They have the metrica] ‘ictus’
In accordance with his remark most editors treet all these cases as
examples of ‘Hiatus’ It is better to consider them to be instanoes of
‘synaloepha’ by which the two syllables coalesco in pronunciation, which
they cannot do in a case of real ‘Hiatus' forthere each letter preserves
its independeut weight.

The following instances will serve to show the extent ol this practice ’
ἱιι Terence:

“ Vide quam iniquus sis prae studio: dam id efficias qued oupis.'’
(And. v. 1. 6.)
