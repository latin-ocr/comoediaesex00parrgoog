have thrown my remarks into a shape of my own, the scholar will
see that I have not sought ιο disguise my obligations to these and
other writers on Latin Versification. The whole subject has been
much neglected; and is so important, perhaps even with a view
to the future settlement of the text of Terence, that I make no
apology for having entered into it fully.

The Fragments of Menander and other Greek authors have been
frequently notieed in the course of the notes. But for the sake of

. the student I have brought together in an Excursus at the end of

the volume all the undoubted passages of Menander and Apollo·
dorus which may be referred ιο ιιο plays imitated by Terence ;
and I haveat the same time considered the general question of the
. relation of Terence to his Greek predecessore.

At the riak of inereasing slightly the bulk of the volume I have
added an Index of the Latinity of Terence, which will, I trust, be
considered an addition to the usefulness of the book. This Index
isbosed on that in Giles’ edition of Zeune before spoken of; but I
found it necessary ιο make innumerable alterations, erasures, and
additions, so that the Index is ιο all intents and purposes a new
one. .

I have aeknowledged my obligation ιο other editors whenevorI
have taken from them quotations which were evidently their own.
Every classical author is, however, overlaid with a mass of illus-
trative matter which may be considered the common property of
commentatore. Of all editors of Terence perhaps most is due in
this way to Westerhovius and Lindenbrog. To avoid unne-
eessary length Ihave often referred the reader to the Dietionary of

Antiquities edited by Dr. Smith.
