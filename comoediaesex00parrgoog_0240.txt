humiliation3 but is ultimately received into favour by bis father upon
his promising to settle and lead a respectable life.

This play is remarkable for a supposed irregularity in its construction,
which has made it the subject of an animated controversy among advo·
cates of the ‘ Unities.’ Itis clear that the opening scene of the play is
laid at evening, when Menedemus is just finishing his day's work. Tha
Third Act commences with the following morning, and in the interval
the supper at Chremes' house takes place. This in itself, though an
exception to the general arrangement of Tereuoe's plays, ia not a very
important matter. rae theory of the ‘ Unities ' is not to be received as
an absolute law for the Drama: aud thora is nothing in this case which
is not abundantly justified by many other instances. Upon this point
turns a theory which was first mooted by Scaliger, and afterwards main·
tained by Madame Dacica—that this play was acted in two porticus:
the first two Acts at night, after sunsei ; and the three remaining Acts
the next morning at break of day, the interval between the two parts
being taken up with the supper at Obremes' house. This idea proceeds
entirely upon the supposed necessity of filling up the interval between
the &cond and Third Acts; and is, as far as we are informed, entirely
gratuitous. Colman has shown the absurdity of the idea very well in
his remarks on this subject. Any one who considers that the Roman ·

Drama was performed in the open air, will at once see the improbability
of such a mode of representation. 'l'he Roman Amphitheatre was at
any time a disadvantageous arena for the Drama. What musthave been
the success of a play, acted partly at nightfall, partly before breakfast
next morning? Nothing but a devotion to the ‘Unities ’ could haveled
to such an idea; aud it will be dismissed without any further discussion,
now that a more artistic idea of Dramatic Unity is generally recognized.
