liv INTRODUOTION. ¹

In conformity with this general principle we heve the following rules:

o. All dissyllnbles were paroxytone3 ns ‘deus’ ‘regnum’ ‘smus’ ‘pirgus’

β. Hyperdissyllebic words with long penultima were paroxytone ; as
‘cmdbunt,’ ‘regndbis’ ‘semrom‘ ‘argentum’

γ. Hyperdissyllabic words with short penultimo were proparoxytone3
as ‘pectoris‘ ‘consili’ ‘deludien’ ‘aureus’

All these rules ere subject to certain modificatione in consequence cf
the position of words in metriosl lines, which I will now briefly consider
with reference to Terence.

α. Dissyllsbles. These areos necessity constently placed in iambic
metre es forming a foot, where, consequently, the nocent falls on

the lest syllable. I take the following instances of the possible

position of suchwords in iambic verse chiefly from the opening scene of
the Andria:

1. “Sed iis quas semper in te intellexi sitas.''
2. “Ego pdstqusm te emi a pdrvulo ut semper tibi.’'
3. “In Pdmphilo ut nihil estmorae, restet Chremes.''

This hest cnse is compemtively rare, ond occurs chiefly when the filth
leot is o spondeo. Two iambic words very rorely end a line.

4. “Nosse dmnia bescochin est adolescentulis.'’
(Eun. v. 4. 18.)

“ Persutsit nox, enter, vinum, ndolescdntin.'¹
(Adelph. iii. 4. 24⁸.)

5. “Sed postquam arram accessit, pretium pdllicens.”
6. “ Nunquam praeponens se illis: its facillime.’¹

These exemples show some os the ceses in which o dissyllsble may stand
alone ns en iambic word, i.e. with the last syllable accented. The ¹
render who desires to enolyse minutcly the werbnl structure cl the
wericus forms of comic verse, moy be referred to Bitschl's discussion ol
this subject in his Prolegomenn to Plautus. Ipnss on now to some
other ceses in which the nocent οἰ words deserves notice. As o general
