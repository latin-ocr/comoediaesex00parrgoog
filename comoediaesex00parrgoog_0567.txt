that ot‘ Meinehe in his note on Menander, Pragm. Fab. Inoert eor
Epimetrum iii. pp. 709, 710. He concaires that the name oi Apollo,
Λοξίας, must have been mentioned by Menander, as the altar rrae
dedicated to him (see my note on the passage), and that the word lies
hid in the corrupt reading Δήλιον or Οαεείοο of Donatus’ text. He
accordingly reads:

ἀπὸ Λοξία ob μυῤῥίνος τασδὶ [λαβὼν]

ὑπότεινε.
We may notice that the same fragment has been interpreted by
Bentley ἀπὸ δεξιᾶς σὺ puppim κλάδους λάβε, and by Jacobs, ἀφ’ ἑστίας
ot μυῤῥίνος δέχου Δυστηνέ. It is not for us to decide between these

differ-ing masters of their craft.
And. iv. 5. 9, in answer to the question of Crito:

“Quid vos? quo pacto hic? satin recte l‘'

Mysis answers:

“-- Nosne? ‘Sic
Ut quimue‚' aiunt, ‘quando ut volumus non licet! ” .

With this is justly compared the fragment ol' Menander which occurs
in Monostich. 190, and is placed by Meinehe expressly among the
fragments of his Ἀνδρία, xiii:

Ζῶμεν γάρ οὔχ ὣς θίλομεν, ἀλλ’ ὧς δυνάμεθα,

In addition to these more express quotations we have a number of less

striking instances, consisting of short phrases or mere allusione,
gothered from the notes of Donatus and Eugraphius. Such are the

following:
“Nihil me fallis.” (And. i. 2. 33.)
Οὐδέν με λονθάνοις dv. (Mein. Fragm. Ἀνδρ. iii.)
“ N e me obsecra.'’ (And. iii. 3. 11.)
Μὴ λιτάνευε, μὴ μάχου.
This last is doubtful. See Meinehe, Fragm. Ἀνδρ. vii:
“Quidnam audio ?” (And. iii. 4. 3,)

where Donatus notices another reading, ‘audiam,’ agreeing with the
words of Menander, τί δήποτ’ ἀκούσιος

“ Sic, Crito, hio est.” (And. at. 16.)
oiircrs atate ε’στε. (Mein. Fragm. Ἀνδρ. xii.)

And on Andria iil. 1. 15:
“ J uno Lucina ier opem,”
