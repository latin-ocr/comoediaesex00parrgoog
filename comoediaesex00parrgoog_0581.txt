‘504 TERENOE AND THE NEW OOMEDM'

which, according to Menander, Chaerea told the tale of his adventurein
Thais’s house (see Donatus on Eun. iii. 4. 1); and probably the
character of Chremes was seltened by Terence, for we find that
Menander made it the representative of a rongh countryman (see note
on Eun. iii. 1. 1). This last alteration we must attribute to Tercnee's
own taste‚if there was any marked departure from Menander. For
we should have expected theta broad and rough character, such as
would be that of a countryman just corne up to town, would hare
pleased the Roman audience. The introduction of Antipho is more
attributable to dramatic consideratione. It is noticeable that Terence
is peculiarly free from soliloquies, and what he has are short. The
following are all the instances in his plays:

Andria, Acti. Scenes 3 and 4.

Eunuchus, Act iii. Scene 55 Act ir. Scenes 1 and 2.

Heautontimorumenos, Act ii. Scene 13 Act iv. Scene 2.

Adelphi, Act i. Scene 1; Act iii. Scene 5; Act ir. Scenes 4 and e;
Act v. Scene 4.

Hecyra, Act ii. Scene 33 Act iii. Scene 3.

Phormio, Act i. Scene 1, Act iv. Scene 2; Act v. Scene 4.

Menander, following the example of Euripides, probably indulged in
long soliloquies, chiefly as prologues3 and he was followed in this
· respect sermore closely by Plautus than by Terence. In the remarks on
Meineke’s First Fragment of the ‘ Colax’ of Menander, Ι have already
observed that Terence departed considerahly from the ordinary practice,
and, ns we may conclude from that fragment, from the particular exam·
ple of Menander, in his treatment of the character of the Braggadocio.
(See p. 494.)

In the‘ Haauronmuonunsuos’ we hare lost the help of the com·
mentary of Donatus; and from his substitute, Eugraphius, we gain no
information of value on the text of Menander. This play has a more .
complicatcd plot than any of the others, and we might easily con·
jecture that part of this complexity is ducto the introduction by
Terence either of original matter or of the plot of some other play.
But we have not eren a hint upon which to argue, and a mere con·
jecture is worse than absolute ignorancc.

In his commentery on the ‘ Anunrm' Donatus mentions one or two
triding departures from the original of Menander. Thus in Menander
it is a brother of Sostrata that is introduced to protect her and her
daughter. In Terence it is Hegio, her late husband’s intimate friend
(Don. on Adelphi iii. 2. 53). The author cf the life of Terence
(whether hc was Suetonius or Donatus) informs us that Varro pre·
ferrcd the exordium of Terence¹s play to that of Menander’s.
