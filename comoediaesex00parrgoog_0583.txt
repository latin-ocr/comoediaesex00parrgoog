of their Latin pupils. A vast masa of Greek literature was at the eon·
. mand of the play-wright. It was generally admired; and a play well

written, or, rather, well translated from one of the Greek plays, was sure
of success. But the point on which Iwish here ιο insist was the extent
of ¹that literature, and the familiarity with it which was possessed by all
the best Roman writers. We must therefore remember‚ in adjustiug
the obligations of Terence to any oue play of Menander, that while he
had before hina as the special object of his imitation some particular
play-say, for instance, the ‘Andria’ or the ίΕιιιιιιοιιιιε,’-Ιιὲ was also
well acquainted with the whole of the Menandrian repertory, and
undoubtedly, whether unconsciously or intentionally, availed himself
always of his knowledge. So, to take an instance from our own litera·
ture, Shakespeare, in the composition of many of his pieces, had before
him more than one author whom he partially followed3 and if in his
case we allow the existence of a presiding genius informing the whole,
and working up the old materiale into anew aud consistent creation, we
may, without any violence to historica] truth, assume the same in the
case of Terence. Our want of informatiou should lead us to be wide
rather thau narrow in our conclusions; aud we may fairly suppose
that even had we before us the plays of Menander from which Te-
rence ia said more expressly to have copied in his existing comedies, we
should yet find in him much that is not in any single Greek play,
and which, if not original, is to be gethered from many other plays
of the same, or perhaps of other authors. (See on the ‘Adelphi,'
p. 497.) The number of fragments of unascertaiued plays of Me·
nander which lit more or less closely with Terence, many of them
quite as well as those passages which are directly quoted from the
correspondiug plays of Menander, lende us to the conclusion that
Terence drew, not only from the single play which he had before him,
but also from his general knowledge of the works of Menander, aud of
the other authors of Greek Comedy with which he was familiar.

These consideratione ara important if we would estimate rightly the
genius of Terence. In language hewas douhtless original. His diction
bears with it the mark ofa refinement and a polished idiom which is not
found iu other Βοοιιιο writers of that period, and which is far superior
to the style of Plautus. The characters and situations of his drama
were no doubt the usual characters and situations of the New Comedy.
Of these enough hasbeen said in the Introduction. But his manner of
treatment must have been his own. And if thie is true of his lauguage,
we must demand a more accurate acquaintance with the plote of the
plays of Menander before we refusa to allow Terence originality in the
general subject of his comediee. The discrepeueiee which have been
already noticed must be taken, as far as they go, for a proof of this
