xiv · INTRODUOTION.

position is confirmed by the fact of his intimacy with Scipio and Laelius,
who must have treated him 'as an equal rather than as adspendent for
the story to have gained ground that he was indebted to them sor the
language and composition of his plays. Even if we suppose Terence to
have been a foreigner and a frecdman, yet we must conclude that his
circumstances were easy, or at all events sufficiently independent to enable
him to be chary os his reputation and fastidious in his style. Poor
authors do not generally set themselves against the prevailing taste ol
their times. Terence was evidently well educated and refined3 and
though this may be attributed exclusively to his natural genius, yet to
indulge his literary tastes and to carry out his own idea os dramatic
composition, which was aninnovation upon the practice of his prede·
cessors in the Roman Drama, he must have been independent of public
approva13 he must have been able to despise the clap-trap artifices of
the popular play-mongers, and to wait his time, elaborating his diction
and his verse, and working ont his pieces after the model of his favourite
Greek masters ¹.

The universal testimony of antiqnity makes Terence to have written
six comedies, and six only. Of the existing plays the ‘Andria’ seems
certainly to have been the earliest, and the ‘Adelphi' the latest; nor
have we any intimation os any other plays but those which we possess.
The perfect state of all the plays of Terence-a question whichis
quite distinct from that of the text—and the possibility os verifying
all existing quotations by the extant plays, lead us to conclude that
we are in possession of all that Terence wrote. It has, however,
been argued with some plausibility that the ‘ Andria’ was not the first
play brought before the public by Terence, aud that there must doubtless
have been other occasions on which he appeared as an author, and
previous attacks of his antagonists which he had been obliged to answer.
This supposition gains colour srom the following passages. For in the
Prologus to the ‘Andria’ he says:

“ Nam· in prologis scribendis operam abutitur,
Non qui argumentum narret, sed qui malevoli

Veteris poetae maledictis respondeat.'’ (vv. 5-7 .)

Here the poet seems certainly to be speaking generally, as if he was
