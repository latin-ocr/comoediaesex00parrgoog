“ xxii > INTRODUOTION.

Eam laudem hic ducit maximam, quum illis placet
Qui vobis universis et populo placent,'’ dra.

(Adelphi, Prolog. 15-19.)

In both of these passages he evidently waives the question; leaving the
decision of it in the first case to the judgment of his hearers, andin the
second case intimating that, evenis it were true, it was a matter of
which he ought to feel proud rather than ashamed. Terence was evi-
dently too good a courtier to deny flatly an imputation which was to ’
the credit of his literary friends. They were no doubt flattered hythe
supposition of their having a share in the compositione ol Terence, and
he did not carate vindicate his own originality at the expense even ot'
their vanity. A compliment of this kind would cost him nothing, and
· would be very acceptable to them. N or perhaps did he consider Lavi-
nius entitled to any explanation on such apoint; and so he declined to
admit or to deny the charge which had been brought against him. On
every ground, then, we may reject this story which gives to Laelius or
Africanus the credit os the authorship of the best parts os the comedies
of Terence. His plays are so even and consistent throughout, indi·
vidually and with one another, that we might well desy any critic to
· show where Terence left off and his friends began. Throughout his
plays there is the same neatneae of language, the same attention to
matre, the same quiet tone os good-natured humour and practical know·
ledge ol' the world. This must have proceeded from one and the same
author, and that author none other than Terence himself.
The last accusation which Terence noticea is that his plays were
deficient in strength, “tenui oratione et scriptura levi'’ (Phorm.
. Prolog. 5), tha complaint made in the famous epigram ascribed to
Caesar, which sums up so accurately the judgmeut os antiquity that it
may be appropriately quoted here :—

“ Tu quoqne tuin summis, 0 dimidiato Menander, ’
Poneris, et merito, puri sermonis amator,
Lenibus atque utinam scriptis adjuncta soret vis
Comica, ut aequato virtus polleret honore
Cum Graecis, neque in hac despectus parte jaceres.
Unum hocmnmror, et doleo tibi deesse, Terenti.’'
