TERENGE ΛΝΒ THE NEW OOMEDY. 505

Of the ‘Hecyra’ and ⁴ Epidicazomenos’ of Apollodorus we know very
little. ln his commentary upon the ‘Phormio' Donatus notices one or
two slight discrepancies (see note on i. 2. 42); affecting merely words
or minor incidente.

From this consideration of the points of resemblance and differ·
ence between Terence and the Greek writers of the New Comedy,
I now pass to some general conclusione which arise from the foregoing
companson.

We can hardly doubt that in the time of Terence, and from a much
earlier period, as is shown in the similar case of Plautus, the works of
the Greek dramatists were generally known and popular at Rome.
There was no doubt a large party among the literary public, if indeed
all the literary men were not of this class, who looked to Greece aa
their mistress ia literature ss wellas in philosophy. The taste for, and
knowledge of, the Greek originale, was in Terence's time generally
diffused, and many Greek plays were probably well known before they
had been reproduced in a Latin form. We have seen in the case of the
‘Phormio’ that that play was probably familiar to the Roman public
before it was produced on the Roman Stage by Terence (see note on
Prolog. v. 26); and the same fact appears in the constant quotatious
of the Greek plays by Cicero and other authors. The Romans
affected to admire the translations of their own countrytnen above the
originale from which they copied. Some, indeed, of them, who had paid
a more careful attention to the comparative merita of the rival natione
as authors and poets, bave had the candour to acknowledge that tho
Greeks surpasscd in delicacy of langnrge, and in refinement of wit, the
compositione of their most successful followers; and that the best parts
of Terence seemed flat and insipid when compared with the clear
diction and sparkling wit of Menander. But, without endeavonn'ng ¹to
discriminate between the rival claims of the foreign aad native schools,
we may conclude that the knowledge of the Greek drama, and more
particularly here of the New Comedy, was widely diffused among the '
litorary men of Rome during the ‘lifetime of our author. Terence had
not to create a taste for the Greek drama. He found it in existence;
and he limited himself to the skilful reproduction of the best models of
that literature.

And as this taste for Greek literature was widely diffused, so we
may feel sure that the Romans bad the advantage of possessing in their
integrity those works of Philemon, Menander, Diphilus, Apollodorus,
and others, of which we can gain only a faint conception horn the study
