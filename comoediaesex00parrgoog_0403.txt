326 INTRODUOTION ΤΟ HEGYRA.

does not last long. Philumena, finding that she has no hope of oon·

oealing her situation from ber mother-in·law, begins to avoid her, and ιο
withdraw from her company as much as possible; till, at last, she goes
to her own mother ou the pretenoe of attending a family sacrifice, and
stays with her, refusing ιο return ιο her mother-inlaw. Sostrata sends
for her, but in vain; and she goes to see her, but is refused admit-
tanoe. ’

This brings us to the beginning oithe Second Act of the play, where
the action really commences; for all that we had hitherto is merelya
kind of prologus. Laches, Pamphilus' father, has now heard os this
estrangement between his wife and his daughter-iadau, and comes into
town ιο look into the matter. Priding himself much upon his wonder·
ful knowledge of every thing that is going on, he lays it down decidedly
that Sostrata alone is to blame; thet all mothers-in·law hate their
daughters-indaw, and that she must have driven Philumena away by her
unkindness; and he is more confirmed in his opinion by the statement
of Phidippus that his daughter refuses to come back to Laches¹ house
while her husband is away. Sostrata in vain endeavours ιο clear her·
sels.

At this moment Philumena's expected child is boru3 and Pamphilus
returns home at the outical moment. Hearing thet his wii'e is ill, he
rushes into the house to see her, and there discovers the whole state of
the case. Myrrhina entreats him to keep the matter quiet, and he so
far retains his affection for bis wife that he promises ιο do ao, and is
wretched at the thoughts oi a separation from her, though he comes to
the conclusion that after this child’s birth, the son of he does not know
whom, it is impossible for him ever ιο receive her back into his house.
Meanwhile he sees the necessity of getting rid of his slave Parmeno,
who will otherwise be sure to discover what is going on. So he sends
him off on two errauds, the last of which keeps him fully employed at a
distance the rest of the day.

The body of the play is occupied by the indignant expostulations of the
two fathers with Pamphilus, and with their wives. Now that Pamphilus
has a son, Laches cannot conceive why he should not take his wife home
again; and Phidippus is furious with him, with Laches, and with
Myrrhina his wife. Sostrata comes to the determination os leaving
town, aud going to live with her husband in the country, hoping that
her absence will remove the last obstacle to Philumena's return; but
notwithstanding this, Pamphilus still persists in his refusal to receive
his wife, aud at last the old men come ιο the conclusion that he must
be still carrying on his old love affair with Bacchis, and determine ιο

send for her, and to endeavour by fair means or foul to break off ber
intimacy with Pamphilus.
