INTRODUCTION.

Tus plot of the Heautontimorumenos turns, as is often the csse,
partly upon the recognition of ashild which had been exposed ιι an
infant. Sostrata the wife of Chremes had ιιι infent daughter, which her
husband refused tobring up, and ordered to beexposed. she gave it to an
old woman for that purpose, attaching ιο ita dress a ring, from asupersti·
tions feeling that the child ought not ιο be entirely disinherited. The old
woman, instead of exposing the child, brought her up as her own daughter,
aad named her Antiphila. When she grew up she attracted the attention
of Clinia sou of Menedemus. Their attachment continued for some time

than was intended3 he found Antiphila alone, for her reputed mother, '
Philtere, had died in the interval, and iu circumstances ⁴which shewed
that she was still faithful to Clinia. Thinking besides to do a stroke of
business forhis own master, he bringa ιι ιιι same time Bacchis, Clitipho’s
mistress, ι very different character from Antiphila: and that Chremes
may have no suspicion of this connection of hie son’s, it ia amanged
that Bacchis shall pass for Clinis's mistress, and Antiphila for one of
her servants. While this ia going on, Chremes and Menedemus have
