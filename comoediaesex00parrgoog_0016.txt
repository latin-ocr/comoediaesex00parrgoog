nach nse to the young or general render, itis yet a valuable and
tarefully edited book.

Of other editions those that Ι have chiefly used have been that
by Perlet (Lips. 1827), Reinhardt (Lips. 1827), and Stallbanm
(Lips1830, 1831). The latter Ι used carefully only for the ‘dudda'
Ι also have referred to the edition of Dr. Hiekie (London, 1837),
which is a compilation from preceding commentatore without much
judgment. Ι have notioed his mistakes in my notes more fre·
quently than I should have done but for the fact that they are
likely to mislead younger studente, by whom his book is often

chief French critics upon Terence's plays.

Ι may here also gladly acknowledge my obligations to the Rev.
A. J. Maeleane and to ΜΓ. Long, the editors of this series of
elassieal authors. To their remarks on my notes as they have
passed through the press Ι am much indebted; and in matters eon-

Ihad by me also, in writing the eommentary on the ‘Andria'
some notes of the Rev. R. Shillcto’s, whose permissiou Ι obtained,
through a pnpil of his, to avail myself of them.

The life and literary position of Terence, considered as a Roman
dathon are diseassed in the following Introduction. In the

express my gratification that, by an independent inquiry inte the usages of Terentina

agreement which tenda to confirm mein my persnasion of the justice of the principles
laid down in the following Introduction. Wheneser Ι have reason, in my commentary, to
diasgree with Mr. Key, or other writers, Ι have endeavoured to express my dissent with-
