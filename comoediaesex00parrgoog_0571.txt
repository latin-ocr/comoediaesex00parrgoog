494 TERENOE AND THE NEW GOMEDY.

quoting. It has already been noticed in the Introduction to the ‘Eunu-
chus’ that the characters of Thraso and Gnatho are in a great degree
different from the stock idea of the Bully and the Toady. It is in·
tenesting to observa that in the following passage, which is distinctly
ascribed to the Κόλαξ of Menander, the grosser traits of the characteres
the Braggadocio appear. Heia made to say:

-- Kordhae χωροῦν δέκα
έν Καππαδοκίᾳ κόνδυ χρυσοῦν, Στρουθία,
πρὶς ἐξέπιον μεστόν γ’. ΣΤ. Ἀλεξάνδρου πλέον

τοῦ βασιλέως πέπωκας. Β. Οὐκ ἔλαττον, οὗ,

μὰ τὴν Ἀθηνᾶν. ΣΤ. Μέγα γε. (Κόλ Fragm. i.)

In a passage of fluidas, ii. p. 327, quoted by Mainake, the Struthias
ol Menander is classed with the old-fashioned parasites‚ such as appear
in the plays of Plautus. Ol Ἕλληνες uaccam τε ᾄδουσι καὶ Θήρηνος
καὶ Στρουθίας καὶ Χαιρεφῶντας, ὀνθρωπους ἐσθίειν εἰδότας εἷς κόρον ml
δεινοὺς γαστέρα. This broad sensual trait is suppreesed in Terence’s
adaptati0n; though we find the same tendency to exaggerated flattery
throughout. ’

In the following passage of the ‘Eunuchus,' where Parmeno presente
the gista of Phaedria, he speaks of his master thus:

“Atque haec qui misit non sibi soli postulat
' Te vivere, et sua causa excludi caeteros,
Neque pugnas narrat; neque cicatrices suas
Ostentat; neque tibi obstat, quod quidam facit.”
(Eunuch. iii. 2. 27-30.)

We find a counterpart to these lines in the following fragment of an
unknown play¹ of Phoenicides. Doubtless tho idea was a common one;
but it ia here expressedin amanner very similar to that of Terence. A

courtesan is expressing her determination to abendon her profession.
It has been a failure.

Md τὴν Ἀφροδίτην οὔκ ἂν ὑπομείναιμ’ ἔτι,

Πυθιάς, ἑταιρεῖν· χαιρέτω· μή μοι λέγε.
ἅπέηιχον· oilla πρὸς ὶρέ· καταλῦσαι θέλω.

And she goes on to give an account ol' the various experiences she has
had with her lovers. The first was a ‘miles gloriosus!

Εὐθὺς ἐπιχειρήσασα φίλον εἶχόν τινα

J στρατιωτικόν· διαπαντὸς αἶπος τὰς μάχαι
ἔλεγεν, ε’δεέκνυ’ ἄρα λέγωντὰ τραύματα,
εἰσέφερε δ’ οὐδέν· δωρεὰν ἔφη τινὰ
